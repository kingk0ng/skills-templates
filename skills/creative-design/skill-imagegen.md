# imagegen

> Use when the user asks to generate or edit images via the OpenAI Image API (for example: generate image, edit/inpaint/mask, background removal or replacement, transparent background, product shots, concept art, covers, or batch variants); run the bundled CLI (`scripts/image_gen.py`) and require `OPENAI_API_KEY` for live calls.

# Image Generation Skill

Generates or edits images for the current project (e.g., website assets, game assets, UI mockups, product mockups, wireframes, logo design, photorealistic images, infographics). Defaults to `gpt-image-1.5` and the OpenAI Image API, and prefers the bundled CLI for deterministic, reproducible runs.

## When to use
- Generate a new image (concept art, product shot, cover, website hero)
- Edit an existing image (inpainting, masked edits, lighting or weather transformations, background replacement, object removal, compositing, transparent background)
- Batch runs (many prompts, or many variants across prompts)

## Decision tree (generate vs edit vs batch)
- If the user provides an input image (or says “edit/retouch/inpaint/mask/translate/localize/change only X”) → **edit**
- Else if the user needs many different prompts/assets → **generate-batch**
- Else → **generate**

## Workflow
1. Decide intent: generate vs edit vs batch (see decision tree above).
2. Collect inputs up front: prompt(s), exact text (verbatim), constraints/avoid list, and any input image(s)/mask(s). For multi-image edits, label each input by index and role; for edits, list invariants explicitly.
3. If batch: write a temporary JSONL under tmp/ (one job per line), run once, then delete the JSONL.
4. Augment prompt into a short labeled spec (structure + constraints) without inventing new creative requirements.
5. Run the bundled CLI (`scripts/image_gen.py`) with sensible defaults (see references/cli.md).
6. For complex edits/generations, inspect outputs (open/view images) and validate: subject, style, composition, text accuracy, and invariants/avoid items.
7. Iterate: make a single targeted change (prompt or mask), re-run, re-check.
8. Save/return final outputs and note the final prompt + flags used.

## Temp and output conventions
- Use `tmp/imagegen/` for intermediate files (for example JSONL batches); delete when done.
- Write final artifacts under `output/imagegen/` when working in this repo.
- Use `--out` or `--out-dir` to control output paths; keep filenames stable and descriptive.

## Dependencies (install if missing)
Prefer `uv` for dependency management.

Python packages:
```
uv pip install openai pillow
```
If `uv` is unavailable:
```
python3 -m pip install openai pillow
```

## Environment
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` must be set for live API calls.

If the key is missing, give the user these steps:
1. Create an API key in the OpenAI platform UI: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
2. Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` as an environment variable in their system.
3. Offer to guide them through setting the environment variable for their OS/shell if needed.
- Never ask the user to paste the full key in chat. Ask them to set it locally and confirm when ready.

If installation isn't possible in this environment, tell the user which dependency is missing and how to install it locally.

## Defaults & rules
- Use `gpt-image-1.5` unless the user explicitly asks for `gpt-image-1-mini` or explicitly prefers a cheaper/faster model.
- Assume the user wants a new image unless they explicitly ask for an edit.
- Require `OPENAI_API_KEY` before any live API call.
- Use the OpenAI Python SDK (`openai` package) for all API calls; do not use raw HTTP.
- If the user requests edits, use `client.images.edit(...)` and include input images (and mask if provided).
- Prefer the bundled CLI (`scripts/image_gen.py`) over writing new one-off scripts.
- Never modify `scripts/image_gen.py`. If something is missing, ask the user before doing anything else.
- If the result isn’t clearly relevant or doesn’t satisfy constraints, iterate with small targeted prompt changes; only ask a question if a missing detail blocks success.

## Prompt augmentation
Reformat user prompts into a structured, production-oriented spec. Only make implicit details explicit; do not invent new requirements.

## Use-case taxonomy (exact slugs)
Classify each request into one of these buckets and keep the slug consistent across prompts and references.

Generate:
- photorealistic-natural — candid/editorial lifestyle scenes with real texture and natural lighting.
- product-mockup — product/packaging shots, catalog imagery, merch concepts.
- ui-mockup — app/web interface mockups that look shippable.
- infographic-diagram — diagrams/infographics with structured layout and text.
- logo-brand — logo/mark exploration, vector-friendly.
- illustration-story — comics, children’s book art, narrative scenes.
- stylized-concept — style-driven concept art, 3D/stylized renders.
- historical-scene — period-accurate/world-knowledge scenes.

Edit:
- text-localization — translate/replace in-image text, preserve layout.
- identity-preserve — try-on, person-in-scene; lock face/body/pose.
- precise-object-edit — remove/replace a specific element (incl. interior swaps).
- lighting-weather — time-of-day/season/atmosphere changes only.
- background-extraction — transparent background / clean cutout.
- style-transfer — apply reference style while changing subject/scene.
- compositing — multi-image insert/merge with matched lighting/perspective.
- sketch-to-render — drawing/line art to photoreal render.

Quick clarification (augmentation vs invention):
- If the user says “a hero image for a landing page”, you may add *layout/composition constraints* that are implied by that use (e.g., “generous negative space on the right for headline text”).
- Do not introduce new creative elements the user didn’t ask for (e.g., adding a mascot, changing the subject, inventing brand names/logos).

Template (include only relevant lines):
```
Use case: <taxonomy slug>
Asset type: <where the asset will be used>
Primary request: <user's main prompt>
Scene/background: <environment>
Subject: <main subject>
Style/medium: <photo/illustration/3D/etc>
Composition/framing: <wide/close/top-down; placement>
Lighting/mood: <lighting + mood>
Color palette: <palette notes>
Materials/textures: <surface details>
Quality: <low/medium/high/auto>
Input fidelity (edits): <low/high>
Text (verbatim): "<exact text>"
Constraints: <must keep/must avoid>
Avoid: <negative constraints>
```

Augmentation rules:
- Keep it short; add only details the user already implied or provided elsewhere.
- Always classify the request into a taxonomy slug above and tailor constraints/composition/quality to that bucket. Use the slug to find the matching example in `references/sample-prompts.md`.
- If the user gives a broad request (e.g., "Generate images for this website"), use judgment to propose tasteful, context-appropriate assets and map each to a taxonomy slug.
- For edits, explicitly list invariants ("change only X; keep Y unchanged").
- If any critical detail is missing and blocks success, ask a question; otherwise proceed.

## Examples

### Generation example (hero image)
```
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: landing page hero
Primary request: a minimal hero image of a ceramic coffee mug
Style/medium: clean product photography
Composition/framing: centered product, generous negative space on the right
Lighting/mood: soft studio lighting
Constraints: no logos, no text, no watermark
```

### Edit example (invariants)
```
Use case: precise-object-edit
Asset type: product photo background replacement
Primary request: replace the background with a warm sunset gradient
Constraints: change only the background; keep the product and its edges unchanged; no text; no watermark
```

## Prompting best practices (short list)
- Structure prompt as scene -> subject -> details -> constraints.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the mode and polish level.
- Use camera/composition language for photorealism.
- Quote exact text and specify typography + placement.
- For tricky words, spell them letter-by-letter and require verbatim rendering.
- For multi-image inputs, reference images by index and describe how to combine them.
- For edits, repeat invariants every iteration to reduce drift.
- Iterate with single-change follow-ups.
- For latency-sensitive runs, start with quality=low; use quality=high for text-heavy or detail-critical outputs.
- For strict edits (identity/layout lock), consider input_fidelity=high.
- If results feel “tacky”, add a brief “Avoid:” line (stock-photo vibe; cheesy lens flare; oversaturated neon; harsh bloom; oversharpening; clutter) and specify restraint (“editorial”, “premium”, “subtle”).

## 📚 Reference Materials


### Cli

# CLI reference (`scripts/image_gen.py`)

This file contains the “command catalog” for the bundled image generation CLI. Keep `SKILL.md` as overview-first; put verbose CLI details here.

## What this CLI does
- `generate`: generate new images from a prompt
- `edit`: edit an existing image (optionally with a mask) — inpainting / background replacement / “change only X”
- `generate-batch`: run many jobs from a JSONL file (one job per line)

Real API calls require **network access** + `OPENAI_API_KEY`. `--dry-run` does not.

## Quick start (works from any repo)
Set a stable path to the skill CLI (default `CODEX_HOME` is `~/.codex`):

```
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export IMAGE_GEN="$CODEX_HOME/skills/imagegen/scripts/image_gen.py"
```

Dry-run (no API call; no network required; does not require the `openai` package):

```
python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate --prompt "Test" --dry-run
```

Generate (requires `OPENAI_API_KEY` + network):

```
uv run --with openai python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate --prompt "A cozy alpine cabin at dawn" --size 1024x1024
```

No `uv` installed? Use your active Python env:

```
python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate --prompt "A cozy alpine cabin at dawn" --size 1024x1024
```

## Guardrails (important)
- Use `python "$IMAGE_GEN" ...` (or equivalent full path) for generations/edits/batch work.
- Do **not** create one-off runners (e.g. `gen_images.py`) unless the user explicitly asks for a custom wrapper.
- **Never modify** `scripts/image_gen.py`. If something is missing, ask the user before doing anything else.

## Defaults (unless overridden by flags)
- Model: `gpt-image-1.5`
- Size: `1024x1024`
- Quality: `auto`
- Output format: `png`
- Background: unspecified (API default). If you set `--background transparent`, also set `--output-format png` or `webp`.

## Quality + input fidelity
- `--quality` works for `generate`, `edit`, and `generate-batch`: `low|medium|high|auto`.
- `--input-fidelity` is **edit-only**: `low|high` (use `high` for strict edits like identity or layout lock).

Example:
```
python "$IMAGE_GEN" edit --image input.png --prompt "Change only the background" --quality high --input-fidelity high
```

## Masks (edits)
- Use a **PNG** mask; an alpha channel is strongly recommended.
- The mask should match the input image dimensions.
- In the edit prompt, repeat invariants (e.g., “change only the background; keep the subject unchanged”) to reduce drift.

## Optional deps
Prefer `uv run --with ...` for an out-of-the-box run without changing the current project env; otherwise install into your active env:

```
uv pip install openai
```

## Common recipes

Generate + also write a downscaled copy for fast web loading:

```
uv run --with openai --with pillow python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate \
  --prompt "A cozy alpine cabin at dawn" \
  --size 1024x1024 \
  --downscale-max-dim 1024
```

Notes:
- Downscaling writes an extra file next to the original (default suffix `-web`, e.g. `output-web.png`).
- Downscaling requires Pillow (use `uv run --with pillow ...` or install it into your env).

Generate with augmentation fields:

```
python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate \
  --prompt "A minimal hero image of a ceramic coffee mug" \
  --use-case "landing page hero" \
  --style "clean product photography" \
  --composition "centered product, generous negative space" \
  --constraints "no logos, no text"
```

Generate multiple prompts concurrently (async batch):

```
mkdir -p tmp/imagegen
cat > tmp/imagegen/prompts.jsonl << 'EOF'
{"prompt":"Cavernous hangar interior with a compact shuttle parked center-left, open bay door","use_case":"game concept art environment","composition":"wide-angle, low-angle, cinematic framing","lighting":"volumetric light rays through drifting fog","constraints":"no logos or trademarks; no watermark","size":"1536x1024"}
{"prompt":"Gray wolf in profile in a snowy forest, crisp fur texture","use_case":"wildlife photography print","composition":"100mm, eye-level, shallow depth of field","constraints":"no logos or trademarks; no watermark","size":"1024x1024"}
EOF

python "$IMAGE_GEN" generate-batch --input tmp/imagegen/prompts.jsonl --out-dir out --concurrency 5

# Cleanup (recommended)
rm -f tmp/imagegen/prompts.jsonl
```

Notes:
- Use `--concurrency` to control parallelism (default `5`). Higher concurrency can hit rate limits; the CLI retries on transient errors.
- Per-job overrides are supported in JSONL (e.g., `size`, `quality`, `background`, `output_format`, `n`, and prompt-augmentation fields).
- `--n` generates multiple variants for a single prompt; `generate-batch` is for many different prompts.
- Treat the JSONL file as temporary: write it under `tmp/` and delete it after the run (don’t commit it).

Edit:

```
python "$IMAGE_GEN" edit --image input.png --mask mask.png --prompt "Replace the background with a warm sunset"
```

## CLI notes
- Supported sizes: `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, or `auto`.
- Transparent backgrounds require `output_format` to be `png` or `webp`.
- Default output is `output.png`; multiple images become `output-1.png`, `output-2.png`, etc.
- Use `--no-augment` to skip prompt augmentation.

### Codex Network

# Codex network approvals / sandbox notes

This guidance is intentionally isolated from `SKILL.md` because it can vary by environment and may become stale. Prefer the defaults in your environment when in doubt.

## Why am I asked to approve every image generation call?
Image generation uses the OpenAI Image API, so the CLI needs outbound network access. In many Codex setups, network access is disabled by default (especially under stricter sandbox modes), and/or the approval policy may require confirmation before networked commands run.

## How do I reduce repeated approval prompts (network)?
If you trust the repo and want fewer prompts, enable network access for the relevant sandbox mode and relax the approval policy.

Example `~/.codex/config.toml` pattern:

```
approval_policy = "never"
sandbox_mode = "workspace-write"

[sandbox_workspace_write]
network_access = true
```

Or for a single session:

```
codex --sandbox workspace-write --ask-for-approval never
```

## Safety note
Use caution: enabling network and disabling approvals reduces friction but increases risk if you run untrusted code or work in an untrusted repository.

- [Use-case tips](#use-case-tips)
- [Where to find copy/paste recipes](#where-to-find-copypaste-recipes)

## Structure
- Use a consistent order: scene/background -> subject -> key details -> constraints -> output intent.
- Include intended use (ad, UI mock, infographic) to set the mode and polish level.
- For complex requests, use short labeled lines instead of a long paragraph.

## Specificity
- Name materials, textures, and visual medium (photo, watercolor, 3D render).
- For photorealism, include camera/composition language (lens, framing, lighting).
- Add targeted quality cues only when needed (film grain, textured brushstrokes, macro detail); avoid generic "8K" style prompts.

## Avoiding “tacky” outputs
- Don’t use vibe-only buzzwords (“epic”, “cinematic”, “trending”, “8k”, “award-winning”, “unreal engine”, “artstation”) unless the user explicitly wants that look.
- Specify restraint: “minimal”, “editorial”, “premium”, “subtle”, “natural color grading”, “soft contrast”, “no harsh bloom”, “no oversharpening”.
- For 3D/illustration, name the finish you want: “matte”, “paper grain”, “ink texture”, “flat color with soft shadow”; avoid “glossy plastic” unless requested.
- Add a short negative line when needed (especially for marketing art): “Avoid: stock-photo vibe; cheesy lens flare; oversaturated neon; excessive bokeh; fake-looking smiles; clutter”.

## Composition & layout
- Specify framing and viewpoint (close-up, wide, top-down) and placement ("logo top-right").
- Call out negative space if you need room for UI or overlays.

## Constraints & invariants
- State what must not change ("keep background unchanged").
- For edits, say "change only X; keep Y unchanged" and repeat invariants on every iteration to reduce drift.

## Text in images
- Put literal text in quotes or ALL CAPS and specify typography (font style, size, color, placement).
- Spell uncommon words letter-by-letter if accuracy matters.
- For in-image copy, require verbatim rendering and no extra characters.

## Multi-image inputs
- Reference inputs by index and role ("Image 1: product, Image 2: style").
- Describe how to combine them ("apply Image 2's style to Image 1").
- For compositing, specify what moves where and what must remain unchanged.

## Iterate deliberately
- Start with a clean base prompt, then make small single-change edits.
- Re-specify critical constraints when you iterate.

## Quality vs latency
- For latency-sensitive runs, start at `quality=low` and only raise it if needed.
- Use `quality=high` for text-heavy or detail-critical images.
- For strict edits (identity preservation, layout lock), consider `input_fidelity=high`.

## Use-case tips
Generate:
- photorealistic-natural: Prompt as if a real photo is captured in the moment; use photography language (lens, lighting, framing); call for real texture (pores, wrinkles, fabric wear, imperfections); avoid studio polish or staging; use `quality=high` when detail matters.
- product-mockup: Describe the product/packaging and materials; ensure clean silhouette and label clarity; if in-image text is needed, require verbatim rendering and specify typography.
- ui-mockup: Describe a real product; focus on layout, hierarchy, and common UI elements; avoid concept-art language so it looks shippable.
- infographic-diagram: Define the audience and layout flow; label parts explicitly; require verbatim text; use `quality=high`.
- logo-brand: Keep it simple and scalable; ask for a strong silhouette and balanced negative space; avoid gradients and fine detail.
- illustration-story: Define panels or scene beats; keep each action concrete; for continuity, restate character traits and outfit each time.
- stylized-concept: Specify style cues, material finish, and rendering approach (3D, painterly, clay); add a short "Avoid" line to prevent tacky effects.
- historical-scene: State the location/date and required period accuracy; constrain clothing, props, and environment to match the era.

Edit:
- text-localization: Change only the text; preserve layout, typography, spacing, and hierarchy; no extra words or reflow unless needed.
- identity-preserve: Lock identity (face, body, pose, hair, expression); change only the specified elements; match lighting and shadows; use `input_fidelity=high` if likeness drifts.
- precise-object-edit: Specify exactly what to remove/replace; preserve surrounding texture and lighting; keep everything else unchanged.
- lighting-weather: Change only environmental conditions (light, shadows, atmosphere, precipitation); keep geometry, framing, and subject identity.
- background-extraction: Request transparent background; crisp silhouette; no halos; preserve label text exactly; optionally add a subtle contact shadow.
- style-transfer: Specify style cues to preserve (palette, texture, brushwork) and what must change; add "no extra elements" to prevent drift.
- compositing: Reference inputs by index; specify what moves where; match lighting, perspective, and scale; keep background and framing unchanged.
- sketch-to-render: Preserve layout, proportions, and perspective; add plausible materials, lighting, and environment; "do not add new elements or text."

## Where to find copy/paste recipes
For copy/paste prompt specs (examples only), see `references/sample-prompts.md`. This file focuses on principles, structure, and iteration patterns.




### Image Api

# Image API quick reference

## Endpoints
- Generate: `POST /v1/images/generations` (`client.images.generate(...)`)
- Edit: `POST /v1/images/edits` (`client.images.edit(...)`)

## Models
- Default: `gpt-image-1.5`
- Alternatives: `gpt-image-1-mini` (for faster, lower-cost generation)

## Core parameters (generate + edit)
- `prompt`: text prompt
- `model`: image model
- `n`: number of images (1-10)
- `size`: `1024x1024`, `1536x1024`, `1024x1536`, or `auto`
- `quality`: `low`, `medium`, `high`, or `auto`
- `background`: `transparent`, `opaque`, or `auto` (transparent requires `png`/`webp`)
- `output_format`: `png` (default), `jpeg`, `webp`
- `output_compression`: 0-100 (jpeg/webp only)
- `moderation`: `auto` (default) or `low`

## Edit-specific parameters
- `image`: one or more input images (first image is primary)
- `mask`: optional mask image (same size, alpha channel required)
- `input_fidelity`: `low` (default) or `high` (support varies by model) - set it to `high` if the user needs a very specific edit and you can't achieve it with the default `low` fidelity.

## Output
- `data[]` list with `b64_json` per image

## Limits & notes
- Input images and masks must be under 50MB.
- Use edits endpoint when the user requests changes to an existing image.
- Masking is prompt-guided; exact shapes are not guaranteed.
- Large sizes and high quality increase latency and cost.
- For fast iteration or latency-sensitive runs, start with `quality=low`; raise to `high` for text-heavy or detail-critical outputs.
- Use `input_fidelity=high` for strict edits (identity preservation, layout lock, or precise compositing).
