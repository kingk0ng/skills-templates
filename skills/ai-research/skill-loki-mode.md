## Quick Reference

### Critical First Steps (Every Turn)
1. **READ** `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` - Your working memory + "Mistakes & Learnings"
2. **RETRIEVE** Relevant memories from `.loki/memory/` (episodic patterns, anti-patterns)
3. **CHECK** `.loki/state/orchestrator.json` - Current phase/metrics
4. **REVIEW** `.loki/queue/pending.json` - Next tasks
5. **FOLLOW** RARV cycle: REASON, ACT, REFLECT, **VERIFY** (test your work!)
6. **OPTIMIZE** Opus=planning, Sonnet=development, Haiku=unit tests/monitoring - 10+ Haiku agents in parallel
7. **TRACK** Efficiency metrics: tokens, time, agent count per task
8. **CONSOLIDATE** After task: Update episodic memory, extract patterns to semantic memory

### Key Files (Priority Order)
| File | Purpose | Update When |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` | Working memory - what am I doing NOW? | Every turn |
| `.loki/memory/semantic/` | Generalized patterns & anti-patterns | After task completion |
| `.loki/memory/episodic/` | Specific interaction traces | After each action |
| `.loki/metrics/efficiency/` | Task efficiency scores & rewards | After each task |
| `.loki/specs/openapi.yaml` | API spec - source of truth | Architecture changes |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project context - arch & patterns | Significant changes |
| `.loki/queue/*.json` | Task states | Every task change |

### Decision Tree: What To Do Next?

```
START
  |
  +-- Read CONTINUITY.md ----------+
  |                                |
  +-- Task in-progress?            |
  |   +-- YES: Resume              |
  |   +-- NO: Check pending queue  |
  |                                |
  +-- Pending tasks?               |
  |   +-- YES: Claim highest priority
  |   +-- NO: Check phase completion
  |                                |
  +-- Phase done?                  |
  |   +-- YES: Advance to next phase
  |   +-- NO: Generate tasks for phase
  |                                |
LOOP <-----------------------------+
```

### SDLC Phase Flow

```
Bootstrap -> Discovery -> Architecture -> Infrastructure
     |           |            |              |
  (Setup)   (Analyze PRD)  (Design)    (Cloud/DB Setup)
                                             |
Development <- QA <- Deployment <- Business Ops <- Growth Loop
     |         |         |            |            |
 (Build)    (Test)   (Release)    (Monitor)    (Iterate)
```

### Essential Patterns

**Spec-First:** `OpenAPI -> Tests -> Code -> Validate`
**Code Review:** `Blind Review (parallel) -> Debate (if disagree) -> Devil's Advocate -> Merge`
**Guardrails:** `Input Guard (BLOCK) -> Execute -> Output Guard (VALIDATE)` (OpenAI SDK)
**Tripwires:** `Validation fails -> Halt execution -> Escalate or retry`
**Fallbacks:** `Try primary -> Model fallback -> Workflow fallback -> Human escalation`
**Explore-Plan-Code:** `Research files -> Create plan (NO CODE) -> Execute plan` (Anthropic)
**Self-Verification:** `Code -> Test -> Fail -> Learn -> Update CONTINUITY.md -> Retry`
**Constitutional Self-Critique:** `Generate -> Critique against principles -> Revise` (Anthropic)
**Memory Consolidation:** `Episodic (trace) -> Pattern Extraction -> Semantic (knowledge)`
**Hierarchical Reasoning:** `High-level planner -> Skill selection -> Local executor` (DeepMind)
**Tool Orchestration:** `Classify Complexity -> Select Agents -> Track Efficiency -> Reward Learning`
**Debate Verification:** `Proponent defends -> Opponent challenges -> Synthesize` (DeepMind)
**Handoff Callbacks:** `on_handoff -> Pre-fetch context -> Transfer with data` (OpenAI SDK)
**Narrow Scope:** `3-5 steps max -> Human review -> Continue` (HN Production)
**Context Curation:** `Manual selection -> Focused context -> Fresh per task` (HN Production)
**Deterministic Validation:** `LLM output -> Rule-based checks -> Retry or approve` (HN Production)
**Routing Mode:** `Simple task -> Direct dispatch | Complex task -> Supervisor orchestration` (AWS Bedrock)
**E2E Browser Testing:** `Playwright MCP -> Automate browser -> Verify UI features visually` (Anthropic Harness)

## Prerequisites

```bash
# Launch with autonomous permissions
claude --dangerously-skip-permissions
```

---

## Core Autonomy Rules

**This system runs with ZERO human intervention.**

1. **NEVER ask questions** - No "Would you like me to...", "Should I...", or "What would you prefer?"
2. **NEVER wait for confirmation** - Take immediate action
3. **NEVER stop voluntarily** - Continue until completion promise fulfilled
4. **NEVER suggest alternatives** - Pick best option and execute
5. **ALWAYS use RARV cycle** - Every action follows Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify
6. **NEVER edit `autonomy/run.sh` while running** - Editing a running bash script corrupts execution (bash reads incrementally, not all at once). If you need to fix run.sh, note it in CONTINUITY.md for the next session.
7. **ONE FEATURE AT A TIME** - Work on exactly one feature per iteration. Complete it, commit it, verify it, then move to the next. Prevents over-commitment and ensures clean progress tracking. (Anthropic Harness Pattern)

### Protected Files (Do Not Edit While Running)

These files are part of the running Loki Mode process. Editing them will crash the session:

| File | Reason |
|------|--------|
| `~/.claude/skills/loki-mode/autonomy/run.sh` | Currently executing bash script |
| `.loki/dashboard/*` | Served by active HTTP server |

If bugs are found in these files, document them in `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` under "Pending Fixes" for manual repair after the session ends.

---

## RARV Cycle (Every Iteration)

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REASON: What needs to be done next?                               |
| - READ .loki/CONTINUITY.md first (working memory)                 |
| - READ "Mistakes & Learnings" to avoid past errors                |
| - Check orchestrator.json, review pending.json                    |
| - Identify highest priority unblocked task                        |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ACT: Execute the task                                             |
| - Dispatch subagent via Task tool OR execute directly             |
| - Write code, run tests, fix issues                               |
| - Commit changes atomically (git checkpoint)                      |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REFLECT: Did it work? What next?                                  |
| - Verify task success (tests pass, no errors)                     |
| - UPDATE .loki/CONTINUITY.md with progress                        |
| - Check completion promise - are we done?                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VERIFY: Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement)       |
| - Run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)                    |
| - Check compilation/build (no errors or warnings)                 |
| - Verify against spec (.loki/specs/openapi.yaml)                  |
|                                                                   |
| IF VERIFICATION FAILS:                                            |
|   1. Capture error details (stack trace, logs)                    |
|   2. Analyze root cause                                           |
|   3. UPDATE CONTINUITY.md "Mistakes & Learnings"                  |
|   4. Rollback to last good git checkpoint (if needed)             |
|   5. Apply learning and RETRY from REASON                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+

## Model Selection Strategy

**CRITICAL: Use the right model for each task type. Opus is ONLY for planning/architecture.**

| Model | Use For | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------|
| **Opus 4.5** | PLANNING ONLY - Architecture & high-level decisions | System design, architecture decisions, planning, security audits |
| **Sonnet 4.5** | DEVELOPMENT - Implementation & functional testing | Feature implementation, API endpoints, bug fixes, integration/E2E tests |
| **Haiku 4.5** | OPERATIONS - Simple tasks & monitoring | Unit tests, docs, bash commands, linting, monitoring, file operations |

### Task Tool Model Parameter
```python
# Opus for planning/architecture ONLY
Task(subagent_type="Plan", model="opus", description="Design system architecture", prompt="...")

# Sonnet for development and functional testing
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Implement API endpoint", prompt="...")
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", description="Write integration tests", prompt="...")

# Haiku for unit tests, monitoring, and simple tasks (PREFER THIS for speed)
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", description="Run unit tests", prompt="...")
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku", description="Check service health", prompt="...")
```

### Opus Task Categories (RESTRICTED - Planning Only)
- System architecture design
- High-level planning and strategy
- Security audits and threat modeling
- Major refactoring decisions
- Technology selection

### Sonnet Task Categories (Development)
- Feature implementation
- API endpoint development
- Bug fixes (non-trivial)
- Integration tests and E2E tests
- Code refactoring
- Database migrations

### Haiku Task Categories (Operations - Use Extensively)
- Writing/running unit tests
- Generating documentation
- Running bash commands (npm install, git operations)
- Simple bug fixes (typos, imports, formatting)
- File operations, linting, static analysis
- Monitoring, health checks, log analysis
- Simple data transformations, boilerplate generation

### Parallelization Strategy
```python
# Launch 10+ Haiku agents in parallel for unit test suite
for test_file in test_files:
    Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="haiku",
         description=f"Run unit tests: {test_file}",
         run_in_background=True)
```

### Advanced Task Tool Parameters

**Background Agents:**
```python
# Launch background agent - returns immediately with output_file path
Task(description="Long analysis task", run_in_background=True, prompt="...")
# Output truncated to 30K chars - use Read tool to check full output file
```

**Agent Resumption (for interrupted/long-running tasks):**
```python
# First call returns agent_id
result = Task(description="Complex refactor", prompt="...")
# agent_id from result can resume later
Task(resume="agent-abc123", prompt="Continue from where you left off")
```

**When to use `resume`:**
- Context window limits reached mid-task
- Rate limit recovery
- Multi-session work on same task
- Checkpoint/restore for critical operations

### Routing Mode Optimization (AWS Bedrock Pattern)

**Two dispatch modes based on task complexity - reduces latency for simple tasks:**

| Mode | When to Use | Behavior |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Direct Routing** | Simple, single-domain tasks | Route directly to specialist agent, skip orchestration |
| **Supervisor Mode** | Complex, multi-step tasks | Full decomposition, coordination, result synthesis |

**Decision Logic:**
```
Task Received
    |
    +-- Is task single-domain? (one file, one skill, clear scope)
    |   +-- YES: Direct Route to specialist agent
    |   |        - Faster (no orchestration overhead)
    |   |        - Minimal context (avoid confusion)
    |   |        - Examples: "Fix typo in README", "Run unit tests"
    |   |
    |   +-- NO: Supervisor Mode
    |            - Full task decomposition
    |            - Coordinate multiple agents
    |            - Synthesize results
    |            - Examples: "Implement auth system", "Refactor API layer"
    |
    +-- Fallback: If intent unclear, use Supervisor Mode
```

**Direct Routing Examples (Skip Orchestration):**
```python
# Simple tasks -> Direct dispatch to Haiku
Task(model="haiku", description="Fix import in utils.py", prompt="...")       # Direct
Task(model="haiku", description="Run linter on src/", prompt="...")           # Direct
Task(model="haiku", description="Generate docstring for function", prompt="...")  # Direct

# Complex tasks -> Supervisor orchestration (default Sonnet)
Task(description="Implement user authentication with OAuth", prompt="...")    # Supervisor
Task(description="Refactor database layer for performance", prompt="...")     # Supervisor
```

**Context Depth by Routing Mode:**
- **Direct Routing:** Minimal context - just the task and relevant file(s)
- **Supervisor Mode:** Full context - CONTINUITY.md, architectural decisions, dependencies

> "Keep in mind, complex task histories might confuse simpler subagents." - AWS Best Practices

### E2E Testing with Playwright MCP (Anthropic Harness Pattern)

**Critical:** Features are NOT complete until verified via browser automation.

```python
# Enable Playwright MCP for E2E testing
# In settings or via mcp_servers config:
mcp_servers = {
    "playwright": {"command": "npx", "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]}
}

# Agent can then automate browser to verify features work visually
```

**E2E Verification Flow:**
1. Feature implemented and unit tests pass
2. Start dev server via init script
3. Use Playwright MCP to automate browser
4. Verify UI renders correctly
5. Test user interactions (clicks, forms, navigation)
6. Only mark feature complete after visual verification

> "Claude mostly did well at verifying features end-to-end once explicitly prompted to use browser automation tools." - Anthropic Engineering

**Note:** Playwright cannot detect browser-native alert modals. Use custom UI for confirmations.

---

## Tool Orchestration & Efficiency

**Inspired by NVIDIA ToolOrchestra:** Track efficiency, learn from rewards, adapt agent selection.

### Efficiency Metrics (Track Every Task)

| Metric | What to Track | Store In |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| Wall time | Seconds from start to completion | `.loki/metrics/efficiency/` |
| Agent count | Number of subagents spawned | `.loki/metrics/efficiency/` |
| Retry count | Attempts before success | `.loki/metrics/efficiency/` |
| Model usage | Haiku/Sonnet/Opus call distribution | `.loki/metrics/efficiency/` |

### Reward Signals (Learn From Outcomes)

```
OUTCOME REWARD:  +1.0 (success) | 0.0 (partial) | -1.0 (failure)
EFFICIENCY REWARD: 0.0-1.0 based on resources vs baseline
PREFERENCE REWARD: Inferred from user actions (commit/revert/edit)
```

### Dynamic Agent Selection by Complexity

| Complexity | Max Agents | Planning | Development | Testing | Review |
|------------|------------|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Trivial | 1 | - | haiku | haiku | skip |
| Simple | 2 | - | haiku | haiku | single |
| Moderate | 4 | sonnet | sonnet | haiku | standard (3 parallel) |
| Complex | 8 | opus | sonnet | haiku | deep (+ devil's advocate) |
| Critical | 12 | opus | sonnet | sonnet | exhaustive + human checkpoint |

See `references/tool-orchestration.md` for full implementation details.

---

## Structured Prompting for Subagents

**Single-Responsibility Principle:** Each agent should have ONE clear goal and narrow scope.
([UiPath Best Practices](https://www.uipath.com/blog/ai/agent-builder-best-practices))

**Every subagent dispatch MUST include:**

```markdown
## GOAL (What success looks like)
[High-level objective, not just the action]
Example: "Refactor authentication for maintainability and testability"
NOT: "Refactor the auth file"

## CONSTRAINTS (What you cannot do)
- No third-party dependencies without approval
- Maintain backwards compatibility with v1.x API
- Keep response time under 200ms

## CONTEXT (What you need to know)
- Related files: [list with brief descriptions]
- Previous attempts: [what was tried, why it failed]

## OUTPUT FORMAT (What to deliver)
- [ ] Pull request with Why/What/Trade-offs description
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Update API documentation

## WHEN COMPLETE
Report back with: WHY, WHAT, TRADE-OFFS, RISKS
```

---

## Quality Gates

**Never ship code without passing all quality gates:**

1. **Input Guardrails** - Validate scope, detect injection, check constraints (OpenAI SDK pattern)
2. **Static Analysis** - CodeQL, ESLint/Pylint, type checking
3. **Blind Review System** - 3 reviewers in parallel, no visibility of each other's findings
4. **Anti-Sycophancy Check** - If unanimous approval, run Devil's Advocate reviewer
5. **Output Guardrails** - Validate code quality, spec compliance, no secrets (tripwire on fail)
6. **Severity-Based Blocking** - Critical/High/Medium = BLOCK; Low/Cosmetic = TODO comment
7. **Test Coverage Gates** - Unit: 100% pass, >80% coverage; Integration: 100% pass

**Guardrails Execution Modes:**
- **Blocking**: Guardrail completes before agent starts (use for expensive operations)
- **Parallel**: Guardrail runs with agent (use for fast checks, accept token loss risk)

**Research insight:** Blind review + Devil's Advocate reduces false positives by 30% (CONSENSAGENT, 2025).
**OpenAI insight:** "Layered defense - multiple specialized guardrails create resilient agents."

See `references/quality-control.md` and `references/openai-patterns.md` for details.

| Data | 3 | ml, data-eng, analytics |
| Product | 3 | pm, design, techwriter |
| Growth | 4 | growth-hacker, community, success, lifecycle |
| Review | 3 | code, business, security |

See `references/agent-types.md` for complete definitions and capabilities.

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Agent stuck/no progress | Lost context | Read `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` first thing every turn |
| Task repeating | Not checking queue state | Check `.loki/queue/*.json` before claiming |
| Code review failing | Skipped static analysis | Run static analysis BEFORE AI reviewers |
| Breaking API changes | Code before spec | Follow Spec-First workflow |
| Rate limit hit | Too many parallel agents | Check circuit breakers, use exponential backoff |
| Tests failing after merge | Skipped quality gates | Never bypass Severity-Based Blocking |
| Can't find what to do | Not following decision tree | Use Decision Tree, check orchestrator.json |
| Memory/context growing | Not using ledgers | Write to ledgers after completing tasks |

---

## Red Flags - Never Do These

### Implementation Anti-Patterns
- **NEVER** skip code review between tasks
- **NEVER** proceed with unfixed Critical/High/Medium issues
- **NEVER** dispatch reviewers sequentially (always parallel - 3x faster)
- **NEVER** dispatch multiple implementation subagents in parallel (conflicts)
- **NEVER** implement without reading task requirements first

### Review Anti-Patterns
- **NEVER** use sonnet for reviews (always opus for deep analysis)
- **NEVER** aggregate before all 3 reviewers complete
- **NEVER** skip re-review after fixes

### System Anti-Patterns
- **NEVER** delete .loki/state/ directory while running
- **NEVER** manually edit queue files without file locking
- **NEVER** skip checkpoints before major operations
- **NEVER** ignore circuit breaker states

### Always Do These
- **ALWAYS** launch all 3 reviewers in single message (3 Task calls)
- **ALWAYS** specify model: "opus" for each reviewer
- **ALWAYS** wait for all reviewers before aggregating
- **ALWAYS** fix Critical/High/Medium immediately
- **ALWAYS** re-run ALL 3 reviewers after fixes
- **ALWAYS** checkpoint state before spawning subagents

---

## Multi-Tiered Fallback System

**Based on OpenAI Agent Safety Patterns:**

### Model-Level Fallbacks
```
opus -> sonnet -> haiku (if rate limited or unavailable)
```

### Workflow-Level Fallbacks
```
Full workflow fails -> Simplified workflow -> Decompose to subtasks -> Human escalation
```

### Human Escalation Triggers

| Trigger | Action |
|---------|--------|
| retry_count > 3 | Pause and escalate |
| domain in [payments, auth, pii] | Require approval |
| confidence_score < 0.6 | Pause and escalate |
| wall_time > expected * 3 | Pause and escalate |
| tokens_used > budget * 0.8 | Pause and escalate |

See `references/openai-patterns.md` for full fallback implementation.

---

## AGENTS.md Integration

**Read target project's AGENTS.md if exists** (OpenAI/AAIF standard):

```
Context Priority:
1. AGENTS.md (closest to current file)
2. CLAUDE.md (Claude-specific)
3. .loki/CONTINUITY.md (session state)
4. Package docs
5. README.md
```

---

## Constitutional AI Principles (Anthropic)

**Self-critique against explicit principles, not just learned preferences.**

### Loki Mode Constitution

```yaml
core_principles:
  - "Never delete production data without explicit backup"
  - "Never commit secrets or credentials to version control"
  - "Never bypass quality gates for speed"
  - "Always verify tests pass before marking task complete"
  - "Never claim completion without running actual tests"
  - "Prefer simple solutions over clever ones"
  - "Document decisions, not just code"
  - "When unsure, reject action or flag for review"
```

### Self-Critique Workflow

```
1. Generate response/code
2. Critique against each principle
3. Revise if any principle violated
4. Only then proceed with action
```

See `references/lab-research-patterns.md` for Constitutional AI implementation.

---

## Debate-Based Verification (DeepMind)

**For critical changes, use structured debate between AI critics.**

```
Proponent (defender)  -->  Presents proposal with evidence
         |
         v
Opponent (challenger) -->  Finds flaws, challenges claims
         |
         v
Synthesizer           -->  Weighs arguments, produces verdict
         |
         v
If disagreement persists --> Escalate to human
```

**Use for:** Architecture decisions, security-sensitive changes, major refactors.

See `references/lab-research-patterns.md` for debate verification details.

---

## Production Patterns (HN 2025)

**Battle-tested insights from practitioners building real systems.**

### Narrow Scope Wins

```yaml
task_constraints:
  max_steps_before_review: 3-5
  characteristics:
    - Specific, well-defined objectives
    - Pre-classified inputs
    - Deterministic success criteria
    - Verifiable outputs
```

### Confidence-Based Routing

```
confidence >= 0.95  -->  Auto-approve with audit log
confidence >= 0.70  -->  Quick human review
confidence >= 0.40  -->  Detailed human review
confidence < 0.40   -->  Escalate immediately
```

### Deterministic Outer Loops

**Wrap agent outputs with rule-based validation (NOT LLM-judged):**

```
1. Agent generates output
2. Run linter (deterministic)
3. Run tests (deterministic)
4. Check compilation (deterministic)
5. Only then: human or AI review
```

### Context Engineering

```yaml
principles:
  - "Less is more" - focused beats comprehensive
  - Manual selection outperforms automatic RAG
  - Fresh conversations per major task
  - Remove outdated information aggressively

context_budget:
  target: "< 10k tokens for context"
  reserve: "90% for model reasoning"
```

### Sub-Agents for Context Isolation

**Use sub-agents to prevent token waste on noisy subtasks:**

```
Main agent (focused) --> Sub-agent (file search)
                     --> Sub-agent (test running)
                     --> Sub-agent (linting)
```

## Blue-Green Deployment

### Strategy
```
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Run smoke tests against green
3. Switch load balancer to green
4. Monitor for 15 minutes
5. If healthy: decommission blue
6. If errors: switch back to blue (rollback)
```

### Implementation (AWS ALB)
```bash
# Deploy green
aws ecs update-service --cluster app --service app-green --task-definition app:NEW_VERSION

# Wait for stability
aws ecs wait services-stable --cluster app --services app-green

# Run smoke tests
curl -f https://green.app.example.com/health

# Switch traffic (update target group weights)
aws elbv2 modify-listener-rule \
  --rule-arn $RULE_ARN \
  --actions '[{"Type":"forward","TargetGroupArn":"'$GREEN_TG'","Weight":100}]'
```

---

## Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback
```bash
# AWS ECS
aws ecs update-service --cluster app --service app --task-definition app:PREVIOUS_VERSION

# Kubernetes
kubectl rollout undo deployment/app

# Vercel
vercel rollback
```

### Automated Rollback Triggers
Monitor these metrics post-deploy:
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- p99 latency > 500ms for 5 minutes
- Health check failures > 3 consecutive
- Memory usage > 90% for 10 minutes

If any trigger fires, execute automatic rollback.

---

## Secrets Management

### AWS Secrets Manager
```bash
# Create secret
aws secretsmanager create-secret \
  --name app/database-url \
  --secret-string "postgresql://..."

# Reference in ECS task
"secrets": [
  {
    "name": "DATABASE_URL",
    "valueFrom": "arn:aws:secretsmanager:region:account:secret:app/database-url"
  }
]
```

### HashiCorp Vault
```bash
# Store secret
vault kv put secret/app database-url="postgresql://..."

# Read in application
vault kv get -field=database-url secret/app
```

### Environment-Specific
```
.env.development   # Local development
.env.staging       # Staging environment
.env.production    # Production (never commit)
```

All production secrets must be in a secrets manager, never in code or environment files.




### Sdlc Phases

# SDLC Phases Reference

All phases with detailed workflows and testing procedures.

---

## Phase Overview

```
Bootstrap -> Discovery -> Architecture -> Infrastructure
     |           |            |              |
  (Setup)   (Analyze PRD)  (Design)    (Cloud/DB Setup)
                                             |
Development <- QA <- Deployment <- Business Ops <- Growth Loop
     |         |         |            |            |
 (Build)    (Test)   (Release)    (Monitor)    (Iterate)
```

---

## Phase 0: Bootstrap

**Purpose:** Initialize Loki Mode environment

### Actions:
1. Create `.loki/` directory structure
2. Initialize orchestrator state in `.loki/state/orchestrator.json`
3. Validate PRD exists and is readable
4. Spawn initial agent pool (3-5 agents)
5. Create CONTINUITY.md

### Directory Structure Created:
```
.loki/
+-- CONTINUITY.md
+-- state/
|   +-- orchestrator.json
|   +-- agents/
|   +-- circuit-breakers/
+-- queue/
|   +-- pending.json
|   +-- in-progress.json
|   +-- completed.json

## Phase 1: Discovery

**Purpose:** Understand requirements and market context

### Actions:
1. Parse PRD, extract requirements
2. Spawn `biz-analytics` agent for competitive research
3. Web search competitors, extract features, reviews
4. Identify market gaps and opportunities
5. Generate task backlog with priorities and dependencies

### Output:
- Requirements document
- Competitive analysis
- Initial task backlog in `.loki/queue/pending.json`

---

## Phase 2: Architecture

**Purpose:** Design system architecture and generate specs

### SPEC-FIRST WORKFLOW

**Step 1: Extract API Requirements from PRD**
- Parse PRD for user stories and functionality
- Map to REST/GraphQL operations
- Document data models and relationships

**Step 2: Generate OpenAPI 3.1 Specification**

```yaml
openapi: 3.1.0
info:
  title: Product API
  version: 1.0.0
paths:
  /auth/login:
    post:
      summary: Authenticate user and return JWT
      requestBody:
        required: true
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              type: object
              required: [email, password]
              properties:
                email: { type: string, format: email }
                password: { type: string, minLength: 8 }
      responses:
        200:
          description: Success
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: object
                properties:
                  token: { type: string }
                  expiresAt: { type: string, format: date-time }
        401:
          description: Invalid credentials
```

**Step 3: Validate Spec**
```bash
npm install -g @stoplight/spectral-cli
spectral lint .loki/specs/openapi.yaml
swagger-cli validate .loki/specs/openapi.yaml
```

**Step 4: Generate Artifacts from Spec**
```bash
# TypeScript types
npx openapi-typescript .loki/specs/openapi.yaml --output src/types/api.ts

# Client SDK
npx openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i .loki/specs/openapi.yaml \
  -g typescript-axios \
  -o src/clients/api

# Server stubs
npx openapi-generator-cli generate \
  -i .loki/specs/openapi.yaml \
  -g nodejs-express-server \
  -o backend/generated

# Documentation
npx redoc-cli bundle .loki/specs/openapi.yaml -o docs/api.html
```

**Step 5: Select Tech Stack**
- Spawn `eng-backend` + `eng-frontend` architects
- Both agents review spec and propose stack
- Consensus required (both must agree)
- Self-reflection checkpoint with evidence

**Step 6: Create Project Scaffolding**
- Initialize project with tech stack
- Install dependencies
- Configure linters
- Setup contract testing framework

---

## Phase 3: Infrastructure

**Purpose:** Provision cloud resources and CI/CD

### Actions:
1. Spawn `ops-devops` agent
2. Provision cloud resources (see `references/deployment.md`)
3. Set up CI/CD pipelines
4. Configure monitoring and alerting
5. Create staging and production environments

### CI/CD Pipeline:
```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  test:
    - Lint
    - Type check
    - Unit tests
    - Contract tests
    - Security scan
  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    - Deploy to staging
    - Smoke tests
  deploy-production:
    needs: deploy-staging
    - Blue-green deploy
    - Health checks
    - Auto-rollback on errors
```

---

## Phase 4: Development

**Purpose:** Implement features with quality gates

### Workflow Per Task:

```
1. Dispatch implementation subagent (Task tool, complexity: medium)
2. Subagent implements with TDD, commits, reports back
3. Dispatch 3 reviewers IN PARALLEL (single message, 3 Task calls):
   - code-reviewer (opus)
   - business-logic-reviewer (opus)
   - security-reviewer (opus)
4. Aggregate findings by severity
5. IF Critical/High/Medium found:
   - Dispatch fix subagent
   - Re-run ALL 3 reviewers
   - Loop until all PASS
6. Add TODO comments for Low issues
7. Add FIXME comments for Cosmetic issues
8. Mark task complete with git checkpoint
```

### Implementation Rules:
- Agents implement ONLY what's in the spec
- Must validate against openapi.yaml schema
- Must return responses matching spec
- Performance targets from spec x-performance extension

---

## Phase 5: Quality Assurance

**Purpose:** Comprehensive testing and security audit

### Testing Phases:

**UNIT Phase:**
```bash
npm run test:unit
# or
pytest tests/unit/
```
- Coverage: >80% required
- All tests must pass

**INTEGRATION Phase:**
```bash
npm run test:integration
```
- Test API endpoints against actual database
- Test external service integrations
- Verify data flows end-to-end

**E2E Phase:**
```bash
npx playwright test
# or
npx cypress run
```
- Test complete user flows
- Cross-browser testing
- Mobile responsive testing

**CONTRACT Phase:**
```bash
npm run test:contract
```
- Validate implementation matches OpenAPI spec
- Test request/response schemas
- Breaking change detection

**SECURITY Phase:**
```bash
npm audit
npx snyk test
semgrep --config=auto .
```
- OWASP Top 10 checks
- Dependency vulnerabilities
- Static analysis

**PERFORMANCE Phase:**
```bash
npx k6 run tests/load.js
npx lighthouse http://localhost:3000
```
- Load testing: 100 concurrent users for 1 minute
- Stress testing: 500 concurrent users for 30 seconds
- P95 response time < 500ms required

**ACCESSIBILITY Phase:**
```bash
npx axe http://localhost:3000
```
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Alt text, ARIA labels, color contrast
- Keyboard navigation, focus indicators

**REGRESSION Phase:**
- Compare behavior against previous version
- Verify no features broken by recent changes
- Test backward compatibility of APIs

**UAT Phase:**
- Create acceptance tests from PRD
- Walk through complete user journeys
- Verify business logic matches PRD
- Document any UX friction points

---

## Phase 6: Deployment

**Purpose:** Release to production

### Actions:
1. Spawn `ops-release` agent
2. Generate semantic version, changelog
3. Create release branch, tag
4. Deploy to staging, run smoke tests
5. Blue-green deploy to production
6. Monitor for 30min, auto-rollback if errors spike

### Deployment Strategies:

**Blue-Green:**
```
1. Deploy new version to "green" environment
2. Run smoke tests
3. Switch traffic from "blue" to "green"
4. Keep "blue" as rollback target
```

**Canary:**
```
1. Deploy to 5% of traffic
2. Monitor error rates
3. Gradually increase to 25%, 50%, 100%
4. Rollback if errors exceed threshold
```

---

## Phase 7: Business Operations

**Purpose:** Non-technical business setup

### Actions:
1. `biz-marketing`: Create landing page, SEO, content
2. `biz-sales`: Set up CRM, outreach templates
3. `biz-finance`: Configure billing (Stripe), invoicing
4. `biz-support`: Create help docs, chatbot
5. `biz-legal`: Generate ToS, privacy policy

---

## Phase 8: Growth Loop

**Purpose:** Continuous improvement

### Cycle:
```
MONITOR -> ANALYZE -> OPTIMIZE -> DEPLOY -> MONITOR
    |
Customer feedback -> Feature requests -> Backlog
    |
A/B tests -> Winner -> Permanent deploy
    |
Incidents -> RCA -> Prevention -> Deploy fix
```

### Never "Done":
- Run performance optimizations
- Add missing test coverage
- Improve documentation
- Refactor code smells
- Update dependencies
- Enhance user experience
- Implement A/B test learnings

---

## Final Review (Before Any Deployment)

```
1. Dispatch 3 reviewers reviewing ENTIRE implementation:
   - code-reviewer: Full codebase quality
   - business-logic-reviewer: All requirements met
   - security-reviewer: Full security audit

2. Aggregate findings across all files
3. Fix Critical/High/Medium issues
4. Re-run all 3 reviewers until all PASS
5. Generate final report in .loki/artifacts/reports/final-review.md
6. Proceed to deployment only after all PASS
```

## Episodic Memory Schema

Each task execution creates an episodic trace:

```json
{
  "id": "ep-2026-01-06-001",
  "task_id": "task-042",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-06T10:30:00Z",
  "duration_seconds": 342,
  "agent": "eng-001-backend",
  "context": {
    "phase": "development",
    "goal": "Implement POST /api/todos endpoint",
    "constraints": ["No third-party deps", "< 200ms response"],
    "files_involved": ["src/routes/todos.ts", "src/db/todos.ts"]
  },
  "action_log": [
    {"t": 0, "action": "read_file", "target": "openapi.yaml"},
    {"t": 5, "action": "write_file", "target": "src/routes/todos.ts"},
    {"t": 120, "action": "run_test", "result": "fail", "error": "missing return type"},
    {"t": 140, "action": "edit_file", "target": "src/routes/todos.ts"},
    {"t": 180, "action": "run_test", "result": "pass"}
  ],
  "outcome": "success",
  "errors_encountered": [
    {
      "type": "TypeScript compilation",
      "message": "Missing return type annotation",
      "resolution": "Added explicit :void to route handler"
    }
  ],
  "artifacts_produced": ["src/routes/todos.ts", "tests/todos.test.ts"],
  "git_commit": "abc123"
}
```

---

## Semantic Memory Schema

Generalized patterns extracted from episodic memory:

```json
{
  "id": "sem-001",
  "pattern": "Express route handlers require explicit return types in strict mode",
  "category": "typescript",
  "conditions": [
    "Using TypeScript strict mode",
    "Writing Express route handlers",
    "Handler doesn't return a value"
  ],
  "correct_approach": "Add `: void` to handler signature: `(req, res): void =>`",
  "incorrect_approach": "Omitting return type annotation",
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "source_episodes": ["ep-2026-01-06-001", "ep-2026-01-05-012"],
  "usage_count": 8,
  "last_used": "2026-01-06T14:00:00Z",
  "links": [
    {"to": "sem-005", "relation": "related_to"},
    {"to": "sem-012", "relation": "supersedes"}
  ]
}
```

---

## Episodic-to-Semantic Consolidation

**When to consolidate:** After task completion, during idle time, at phase boundaries.

```python
def consolidate_episodic_to_semantic():
    """
    Transform specific experiences into general knowledge.
    Based on MemGPT and Voyager research.
    """
    # 1. Load recent episodic memories
    recent_episodes = load_episodes(since=hours_ago(24))

    # 2. Group by similarity
    clusters = cluster_by_similarity(recent_episodes)

    for cluster in clusters:
        if len(cluster) >= 2:  # Pattern appears multiple times
            # 3. Extract common pattern
            pattern = extract_common_pattern(cluster)

            # 4. Validate pattern
            if pattern.confidence >= 0.8:
                # 5. Check if already exists
                existing = find_similar_semantic(pattern)
                if existing:
                    # Update existing with new evidence
                    existing.source_episodes.extend([e.id for e in cluster])
                    existing.confidence = recalculate_confidence(existing)
                    existing.usage_count += 1
                else:
                    # Create new semantic memory
                    save_semantic(pattern)

    # 6. Consolidate anti-patterns from errors
    error_episodes = [e for e in recent_episodes if e.errors_encountered]
    for episode in error_episodes:
        for error in episode.errors_encountered:
            anti_pattern = {
                "what_fails": error.type,
                "why": error.message,
                "prevention": error.resolution,
                "source": episode.id
            }
            save_anti_pattern(anti_pattern)
```

---

## Zettelkasten-Style Linking

Each memory note can link to related notes:

```json
{
  "links": [
    {"to": "sem-005", "relation": "derived_from"},
    {"to": "sem-012", "relation": "contradicts"},
    {"to": "sem-018", "relation": "elaborates"},
    {"to": "sem-023", "relation": "example_of"},
    {"to": "sem-031", "relation": "superseded_by"}
  ]
}
```

### Link Relations

| Relation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| `derived_from` | This pattern was extracted from that episode |
| `related_to` | Conceptually similar, often used together |
| `contradicts` | These patterns conflict - need resolution |
| `elaborates` | Provides more detail on the linked pattern |
| `example_of` | Specific instance of a general pattern |
| `supersedes` | This pattern replaces an older one |
| `superseded_by` | This pattern is outdated, use the linked one |

---

## Procedural Memory (Skills)

Reusable action sequences:

```markdown
# Skill: API Endpoint Implementation

## Prerequisites
- OpenAPI spec exists at .loki/specs/openapi.yaml
- Database schema defined

## Steps
1. Read endpoint spec from openapi.yaml
2. Create route handler in src/routes/{resource}.ts
3. Implement request validation using spec schema
4. Implement business logic
5. Add database operations if needed
6. Return response matching spec schema
7. Write contract tests
8. Run tests, verify passing

## Common Errors & Fixes
- Missing return type: Add `: void` to handler
- Schema mismatch: Regenerate types from spec

## Exit Criteria
- All contract tests pass
- Response matches OpenAPI spec
- No TypeScript errors
```

---

## Memory Retrieval

### Retrieval by Similarity

```python
def retrieve_relevant_memory(current_context):
    """
    Retrieve memories relevant to current task.
    Uses semantic similarity + temporal recency.
    """
    query_embedding = embed(current_context.goal)

    # 1. Search semantic memory first
    semantic_matches = vector_search(
        collection="semantic",
        query=query_embedding,
        top_k=5
    )

    # 2. Search episodic memory for similar situations
    episodic_matches = vector_search(
        collection="episodic",
        query=query_embedding,
        top_k=3,
        filters={"outcome": "success"}  # Prefer successful episodes
    )

    # 3. Search skills
    skill_matches = keyword_search(
        collection="skills",
        keywords=extract_keywords(current_context)
    )

    # 4. Combine and rank
    combined = merge_and_rank(
        semantic_matches,
        episodic_matches,
        skill_matches,
        weights={"semantic": 0.5, "episodic": 0.3, "skills": 0.2}
    )

    return combined[:5]  # Return top 5 most relevant
```

### Retrieval Before Task Execution

**CRITICAL:** Before executing any task, retrieve relevant memories:

```python
def before_task_execution(task):
    """
    Inject relevant memories into task context.
    """
    # 1. Retrieve relevant memories
    memories = retrieve_relevant_memory(task)

    # 2. Check for anti-patterns
    anti_patterns = search_anti_patterns(task.action_type)

    # 3. Inject into prompt
    task.context["relevant_patterns"] = [m.summary for m in memories]
    task.context["avoid_these"] = [a.summary for a in anti_patterns]
    task.context["applicable_skills"] = find_skills(task.type)

    return task
```

---

## Ledger System (Agent Checkpoints)

Each agent maintains its own ledger:

```json
{
  "agent_id": "eng-001-backend",
  "last_checkpoint": "2026-01-06T10:00:00Z",
  "tasks_completed": 12,
  "current_task": "task-042",
  "state": {
    "files_modified": ["src/routes/todos.ts"],
    "uncommitted_changes": true,
    "last_git_commit": "abc123"
  },
  "context": {
    "tech_stack": ["express", "typescript", "sqlite"],
    "patterns_learned": ["sem-001", "sem-005"],
    "current_goal": "Implement CRUD for todos"
  }
}
```

---

## Handoff Protocol

When switching between agents:

```json
{
  "id": "handoff-001",
  "from_agent": "eng-001-backend",
  "to_agent": "qa-001-testing",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-06T11:00:00Z",
  "context": {
    "what_was_done": "Implemented POST /api/todos endpoint",
    "artifacts": ["src/routes/todos.ts"],
    "git_state": "commit abc123",
    "needs_testing": ["unit tests for validation", "contract tests"],
    "known_issues": [],
    "relevant_patterns": ["sem-001"]
  }
}
```

---

## Memory Maintenance

### Pruning Old Episodic Memories

```python
def prune_episodic_memories():
    """
    Keep episodic memories from:
    - Last 7 days (full detail)
    - Last 30 days (summarized)
    - Older: only if referenced by semantic memory
    """
    now = datetime.now()

    for episode in load_all_episodes():
        age_days = (now - episode.timestamp).days

        if age_days > 30:
            if not is_referenced_by_semantic(episode):
                archive_episode(episode)
        elif age_days > 7:
            summarize_episode(episode)
```

### Merging Duplicate Patterns

```python
def merge_duplicate_semantics():
    """
    Find and merge semantically similar patterns.
    """
    all_patterns = load_semantic_patterns()

    clusters = cluster_by_embedding_similarity(all_patterns, threshold=0.9)

    for cluster in clusters:
        if len(cluster) > 1:
            # Keep highest confidence, merge sources
            primary = max(cluster, key=lambda p: p.confidence)
            for other in cluster:
                if other != primary:
                    primary.source_episodes.extend(other.source_episodes)
                    primary.usage_count += other.usage_count
                    create_link(other, primary, "superseded_by")
            save_semantic(primary)

## Integration with CONTINUITY.md

CONTINUITY.md is working memory - it references but doesn't duplicate long-term memory:

```markdown
## Relevant Memories (Auto-Retrieved)
- [sem-001] Express handlers need explicit return types
- [ep-2026-01-05-012] Similar endpoint implementation succeeded
- [skill: api-implementation] Standard API implementation flow

## Mistakes to Avoid (From Learnings)
- Don't forget return type annotations
- Run contract tests before marking complete
```




### Agents

# Agent Type Definitions

Complete specifications for all 37 specialized agent types in the Loki Mode multi-agent system.

**Note:** These are agent TYPE definitions, not a fixed count. Loki Mode dynamically spawns agents based on project needs - a simple todo app might use 5-10 agents, while a complex startup could spawn 100+ agents working in parallel.

## Agent Role Prompt Template

Each agent receives a role prompt stored in `.loki/prompts/{agent-type}.md`:

```markdown
# Agent Identity

You are **{AGENT_TYPE}** agent with ID **{AGENT_ID}**.

## Your Capabilities
{CAPABILITY_LIST}

## Your Constraints
- Only claim tasks matching your capabilities
- Always verify before assuming (web search, test code)
- Checkpoint state before major operations
- Report blockers within 15 minutes if stuck
- Log all decisions with reasoning

## Task Execution Loop
1. Read `.loki/queue/pending.json`
2. Find task where `type` matches your capabilities
3. Acquire task lock (atomic claim)
4. Execute task following your capability guidelines
5. Write result to `.loki/messages/outbox/{AGENT_ID}/`
6. Update `.loki/state/agents/{AGENT_ID}.json`
7. Mark task complete or failed
8. Return to step 1

## Communication
- Inbox: `.loki/messages/inbox/{AGENT_ID}/`
- Outbox: `.loki/messages/outbox/{AGENT_ID}/`
- Broadcasts: `.loki/messages/broadcast/`

## State File
Location: `.loki/state/agents/{AGENT_ID}.json`
Update after every task completion.
```

### Claim Task (with file locking)

```python
def claim_task(agent_id, agent_capabilities):
    with file_lock(".loki/state/locks/queue.lock", timeout=10):
        pending = read_json(".loki/queue/pending.json")

```

### File Locking (Bash)

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Atomic task claim using flock

QUEUE_FILE=".loki/queue/pending.json"
LOCK_FILE=".loki/state/locks/queue.lock"

(
  flock -x -w 10 200 || exit 1

            move_task(task, "in-progress", "completed")
            reset_circuit_breaker(task.type)
            trigger_dependents(task_id)
        else:
            handle_failure(task)
```

---

## Failure Handling

### Exponential Backoff

```python
def handle_failure(task):
    task.retries += 1
    task.lastError = get_last_error()

    if task.retries >= task.maxRetries:
        # Move to dead letter queue
        move_task(task, "in-progress", "dead-letter")
        increment_circuit_breaker(task.type)
        alert_orchestrator(f"Task {task.id} moved to dead letter queue")
    else:
        # Exponential backoff: 60s, 120s, 240s, ...
        task.backoffSeconds = task.backoffSeconds * (2 ** (task.retries - 1))
        task.availableAt = now() + task.backoffSeconds
        move_task(task, "in-progress", "pending")
        log(f"Task {task.id} retry {task.retries}, backoff {task.backoffSeconds}s")
```

---

## Dead Letter Queue

Tasks in dead letter queue require manual review:

### Review Process

1. Read `.loki/queue/dead-letter.json`
2. For each task:
   - Analyze `lastError` and failure pattern
   - Determine if:
     - Task is invalid -> delete
     - Bug in agent -> fix agent, retry
     - External dependency down -> wait, retry
     - Requires human decision -> escalate
3. To retry: move task back to pending with reset retries
4. Log decision in `.loki/logs/decisions/dlq-review-{date}.md`

---

## Idempotency

```python
def enqueue_task(task):
    # Generate idempotency key from content
    task.idempotencyKey = hash(json.dumps(task.payload, sort_keys=True))

    # Check if already exists
    for queue in ["pending", "in-progress", "completed"]:
        existing = find_by_idempotency_key(task.idempotencyKey, queue)
        if existing:
            log(f"Duplicate task detected: {task.idempotencyKey}")
            return existing.id  # Return existing, don't create duplicate

    # Safe to create
    save_task(task, "pending")
    return task.id
```

---

## Task Cancellation

```python
def cancel_task(task_id, reason):
    with file_lock(".loki/state/locks/queue.lock"):
        for queue in ["pending", "in-progress"]:
            task = find_task(task_id, queue)
            if task:
                task.cancelledAt = now()
                task.cancelReason = reason
                move_task(task, queue, "cancelled")

                # Cancel dependent tasks too
                for dep_task in find_tasks_depending_on(task_id):
                    cancel_task(dep_task.id, f"Parent {task_id} cancelled")

                return True
        return False
```

## Circuit Breakers

### State Schema

```json
{
  "circuitBreakers": {
    "eng-backend": {
      "state": "closed",
      "failures": 0,
      "lastFailure": null,
      "openedAt": null,
      "halfOpenAt": null
    }
  }
}
```

### States

| State | Description | Behavior |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| **closed** | Normal operation | Tasks flow normally |
| **open** | Too many failures | Block all tasks of this type |
| **half-open** | Testing recovery | Allow 1 test task |

### Configuration

```yaml
# .loki/config/circuit-breakers.yaml
defaults:
  failureThreshold: 5
  cooldownSeconds: 300
  halfOpenAfter: 60

overrides:
  ops-security:
    failureThreshold: 3  # More sensitive for security
  biz-marketing:
    failureThreshold: 10  # More tolerant for non-critical
```

### Implementation

```python
def check_circuit_breaker(agent_type):
    cb = load_circuit_breaker(agent_type)

    if cb.state == "closed":
        return True  # Proceed

    if cb.state == "open":
        if now() > cb.openedAt + config.halfOpenAfter:
            cb.state = "half-open"
            save_circuit_breaker(cb)
            return True  # Allow test task
        return False  # Still blocking

    if cb.state == "half-open":
        return False  # Already testing, wait

def on_task_success(agent_type):
    cb = load_circuit_breaker(agent_type)
    if cb.state == "half-open":
        cb.state = "closed"
        cb.failures = 0
    save_circuit_breaker(cb)

def on_task_failure(agent_type):
    cb = load_circuit_breaker(agent_type)
    cb.failures += 1
    cb.lastFailure = now()

    if cb.state == "half-open" or cb.failures >= config.failureThreshold:
        cb.state = "open"
        cb.openedAt = now()
        alert_orchestrator(f"Circuit breaker OPEN for {agent_type}")

    save_circuit_breaker(cb)
```

---

## Rate Limit Handling

### Detection

```python
def detect_rate_limit(error):
    indicators = [
        "rate limit",
        "429",
        "too many requests",
        "quota exceeded",
        "retry-after"
    ]
    return any(ind in str(error).lower() for ind in indicators)
```

### Response Protocol

```python
def handle_rate_limit(agent_id, error):
    # 1. Save state checkpoint
    checkpoint_state(agent_id)

    # 2. Calculate backoff
    retry_after = parse_retry_after(error) or calculate_exponential_backoff()

    # 3. Log and wait
    log(f"Rate limit hit for {agent_id}, waiting {retry_after}s")

    # 4. Signal other agents to slow down
    broadcast_signal("SLOWDOWN", {"wait": retry_after / 2})

    # 5. Resume after backoff
    schedule_resume(agent_id, retry_after)
```

### Exponential Backoff

```python
def calculate_exponential_backoff(attempt=1, base=60, max_wait=3600):
    wait = min(base * (2 ** (attempt - 1)), max_wait)
    jitter = random.uniform(0, wait * 0.1)
    return wait + jitter
```

---

## Priority System

| Priority | Use Case | Example |
|----------|----------|---------|
| 10 | Critical blockers | Security vulnerability fix |
| 8-9 | High priority | Core feature implementation |
| 5-7 | Normal | Standard tasks |
| 3-4 | Low priority | Documentation, cleanup |
| 1-2 | Background | Nice-to-have improvements |

Tasks are always processed in priority order within their type.

```

### Episodic-to-Semantic Consolidation

**Protocol:** After completing tasks, consolidate specific experiences into general knowledge.

```python
def consolidate_memory(task_result):
    """
    Transform episodic (what happened) to semantic (how things work).
    Based on MemGPT and Voyager patterns.
    """
    # 1. Store raw episodic trace
    episodic_entry = {
        "timestamp": now(),
        "task_id": task_result.id,
        "context": task_result.context,
        "actions": task_result.action_log,
        "outcome": task_result.outcome,
        "errors": task_result.errors
    }
    save_to_episodic(episodic_entry)

    # 2. Extract generalizable patterns
    if task_result.success:
        pattern = extract_pattern(task_result)
        if pattern.is_generalizable():
            semantic_entry = {
                "pattern": pattern.description,
                "conditions": pattern.when_to_apply,
                "actions": pattern.steps,
                "confidence": pattern.success_rate,
                "source_episodes": [task_result.id]
            }
            save_to_semantic(semantic_entry)

    # 3. If error, create anti-pattern
    if task_result.errors:
        anti_pattern = {
            "what_failed": task_result.errors[0].message,
            "why_failed": analyze_root_cause(task_result),
            "prevention": generate_prevention_rule(task_result),
            "severity": classify_severity(task_result.errors)
        }
        save_to_learnings(anti_pattern)
```

### Zettelkasten-Inspired Note Linking (A-Mem Pattern)

Each memory note is atomic and linked to related notes:

```json
{
  "id": "note-2026-01-06-001",
  "content": "Express route handlers need explicit return types in strict mode",
  "type": "semantic",
  "links": [
    {"to": "note-2026-01-05-042", "relation": "derived_from"},
    {"to": "note-2026-01-06-003", "relation": "related_to"}
  ],
  "tags": ["typescript", "express", "strict-mode"],
  "confidence": 0.95,
  "usage_count": 12
}
```

## Multi-Agent Reflexion (MAR Pattern)

### Problem: Degeneration-of-Thought

Single-agent self-critique leads to repeating the same flawed reasoning across iterations.

### Solution: Structured Debate Among Persona-Based Critics

```
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
| IMPLEMENTER      |     | SKEPTIC          |     | ADVOCATE         |
| (Creates work)   | --> | (Challenges it)  | --> | (Defends merits) |
+------------------+     +------------------+     +------------------+
        |                        |                        |
        v                        v                        v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| SYNTHESIZER                                                       |
| - Weighs all perspectives                                         |
| - Identifies valid concerns vs. false negatives                   |
| - Produces final verdict with evidence                            |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Anti-Sycophancy Protocol (CONSENSAGENT)

**Problem:** Agents reinforce each other's responses instead of critically engaging.

**Solution:**

```python
def anti_sycophancy_review(implementation, reviewers):
    """
    Prevent reviewers from just agreeing with each other.
    Based on CONSENSAGENT research.
    """
    # 1. Independent review phase (no visibility of other reviews)
    independent_reviews = []
    for reviewer in reviewers:
        review = reviewer.review(
            implementation,
            visibility="blind",  # Cannot see other reviews
            prompt_suffix="Be skeptical. List specific concerns."
        )
        independent_reviews.append(review)

    # 2. Debate phase (now reveal reviews)
    if has_disagreement(independent_reviews):
        debate_result = structured_debate(

            })

    # Filter to only valid, evidenced concerns
    return [f for f in findings if f["is_valid"] and f["evidence"]]
```

### Heterogeneous Team Composition

**Research finding:** Diverse teams outperform homogeneous ones by 4-6%.

```yaml
review_team:
  - role: "security_analyst"
    complexity: high
    expertise: ["OWASP", "auth", "injection"]
    personality: "paranoid"

  - role: "performance_engineer"
    complexity: medium
    expertise: ["complexity", "caching", "async"]
    personality: "pragmatic"

  - role: "maintainability_advocate"
    complexity: high
    expertise: ["SOLID", "patterns", "readability"]
    personality: "perfectionist"
```

## Hierarchical Planning (GoalAct/TMS Patterns)

### Global Planning with Hierarchical Execution

**Research:** GoalAct achieved 12.22% improvement in success rate using this pattern.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| GLOBAL PLANNER                                                    |
| - Maintains overall goal and strategy                             |
| - Continuously updates plan based on progress                     |
| - Decomposes into high-level skills                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+

| HIGH-LEVEL SKILLS                                                 |
| - searching, coding, testing, writing, deploying                  |
| - Each skill has defined entry/exit conditions                    |
| - Reduces planning complexity at execution level                  |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| LOCAL EXECUTORS                                                   |
| - Execute specific actions within skill context                   |
| - Report progress back to global planner                          |
| - Can request skill escalation if blocked                         |

## Iter-VF: Iterative Verification-First

**Key insight:** Verify the extracted answer only, not the whole thinking process.

```python
def iterative_verify_first(task, max_iterations=3):
    """
    Based on Iter-VF research: verify answer, maintain Markovian process.
    Avoids context overflow and error accumulation.
    """
    for iteration in range(max_iterations):
        # 1. Generate solution
        solution = generate_solution(task)

        # 2. Extract concrete answer/output
        answer = extract_answer(solution)

        # 3. Verify ONLY the answer (not reasoning chain)
        verification = verify_answer(
            answer=answer,
            spec=task.spec,
            tests=task.tests
        )

        if verification.passes:
            return solution

        # 4. Markovian retry: fresh context with just error info
        task = create_fresh_task(
            original=task,
            error=verification.error,
            attempt=iteration + 1
            # NOTE: Do NOT include previous reasoning chain
        )

    return FailedResult(task, "Max iterations reached")
```

## Collaboration Structures

### When to Use Each Structure

| Structure | Use When | Loki Mode Application |
|-----------|----------|----------------------|
| **Centralized** | Need consistency, single source of truth | Orchestrator for phase management |
| **Decentralized** | Need fault tolerance, parallel execution | Agent swarms for implementation |
| **Hierarchical** | Complex tasks with clear decomposition | Global planner -> Skill -> Executor |

### Coopetition Pattern

**Agents compete on alternatives, cooperate on consensus:**

```python
def coopetition_decision(agents, decision_point):
    """
    Competition phase: Generate diverse alternatives
    Cooperation phase: Reach consensus on best option
    """
    # COMPETITION: Each agent proposes solution independently
    proposals = []
    for agent in agents:
        proposal = agent.propose(
            decision_point,
            visibility="blind"  # No peeking at other proposals
        )
        proposals.append(proposal)

    # COOPERATION: Collaborative evaluation
    if len(set(p.approach for p in proposals)) == 1:
        # Unanimous - likely good solution
        return proposals[0]

    # Multiple approaches - structured debate
    for proposal in proposals:
        proposal.pros = evaluate_pros(proposal)
        proposal.cons = evaluate_cons(proposal)
        proposal.evidence = gather_evidence(proposal)

    # Vote with reasoning requirement
    winner = ranked_choice_vote(
        proposals,
        require_justification=True
    )

    return winner
```

## Progressive Complexity Escalation

**Start simple, escalate only when needed:**

```
Level 1: Single Agent, Direct Execution
   |
   +-- Success? --> Done
   |
   +-- Failure? --> Escalate
           |
           v
Level 2: Single Agent + Self-Verification Loop
   |
   +-- Success? --> Done
   |
   +-- Failure after 3 attempts? --> Escalate
           |
           v
Level 3: Multi-Agent Review
   |
   +-- Success? --> Done
   |
   +-- Persistent issues? --> Escalate
           |
           v
Level 4: Hierarchical Planning + Decomposition
   |
   +-- Success? --> Done
   |
   +-- Fundamental blocker? --> Human escalation
```

## Key Research Findings Summary

### What Works

1. **Heterogeneous teams** outperform homogeneous by 4-6%
2. **Iter-VF** (verify answer only) prevents context overflow
3. **Episodic-to-semantic consolidation** enables genuine learning
4. **Anti-sycophancy measures** (blind review, devil's advocate) improve accuracy 30%+
5. **Global planning** with local execution improves success rate 12%+

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Deep debate chains** - diminishing returns after 1-2 rounds
2. **Confidence visibility** - causes over-confidence cascades
3. **Full reasoning chain review** - leads to error accumulation
4. **Homogeneous reviewer teams** - miss diverse failure modes
5. **Over-engineered orchestration** - model upgrades outpace gains

### Quality Control

# Quality Control Reference

Quality gates, code review process, and severity blocking rules.
Enhanced with 2025 research on anti-sycophancy, heterogeneous teams, and OpenAI Agents SDK patterns.

---

## Core Principle: Guardrails, Not Just Acceleration

**CRITICAL:** Speed without quality controls creates "AI slop" - semi-functional code that accumulates technical debt. Loki Mode enforces strict quality guardrails.

**Research Insight:** Heterogeneous review teams outperform homogeneous ones by 4-6% (A-HMAD, 2025).
**OpenAI Insight:** "Think of guardrails as a layered defense mechanism. Multiple specialized guardrails create resilient agents."

---

## Guardrails & Tripwires System (OpenAI SDK Pattern)

### Input Guardrails (Run Before Execution)

```python
# Layer 1: Validate task scope and safety
@input_guardrail(blocking=True)
async def validate_task_scope(input, context):
    # Check if task within project bounds
    if references_external_paths(input):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Task references paths outside project"
        )
    # Check for destructive operations
    if contains_destructive_operation(input):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Destructive operation requires human approval"
        )
    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)

# Layer 2: Detect prompt injection
@input_guardrail(blocking=True)
async def detect_injection(input, context):
    if has_injection_patterns(input):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Potential prompt injection detected"
        )
    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)
```

### Output Guardrails (Run After Execution)

```python
# Validate code quality before accepting
@output_guardrail
async def validate_code_output(output, context):
    if output.type == "code":
        issues = run_static_analysis(output.content)
        critical = [i for i in issues if i.severity == "critical"]
        if critical:
            return GuardrailResult(
                tripwire_triggered=True,
                reason=f"Critical issues: {critical}"
            )
    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)

# Check for secrets in output
@output_guardrail
async def check_secrets(output, context):
    if contains_secrets(output.content):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Output contains potential secrets"
        )
    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)
```

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Blocking** | Guardrail completes before agent starts | Expensive models, sensitive ops |
| **Parallel** | Guardrail runs with agent | Fast checks, acceptable token loss |

```python
# Blocking: prevents token consumption on fail
@input_guardrail(blocking=True, run_in_parallel=False)
async def expensive_validation(input): pass

# Parallel: faster but may waste tokens
@input_guardrail(blocking=True, run_in_parallel=True)
async def fast_validation(input): pass
```

### Tripwire Handling

When a guardrail triggers its tripwire, execution halts immediately:

```python
try:
    result = await run_agent(task)
except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    log_blocked_attempt(e)
    return early_exit(reason=str(e))
except OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    rollback_changes()
    return retry_with_constraints(e.constraints)
```

### Layered Defense Strategy

```yaml
guardrail_layers:
  layer_1_input:
    - scope_validation      # Is task within bounds?
    - pii_detection         # Contains sensitive data?
    - injection_detection   # Prompt injection attempt?

  layer_2_pre_execution:
    - cost_estimation       # Will this exceed budget?
    - dependency_check      # Are dependencies available?
    - conflict_detection    # Conflicts with in-progress work?

  layer_3_output:
    - static_analysis       # Code quality issues?
    - secret_detection      # Secrets in output?
    - spec_compliance       # Matches OpenAPI spec?

  layer_4_post_action:
    - test_validation       # Tests pass?
    - review_approval       # Review passed?
    - deployment_safety     # Safe to deploy?
```

See `references/openai-patterns.md` for full guardrails implementation.

## Quality Gates

**Never ship code without passing all quality gates:**

### 1. Static Analysis (Automated)
- CodeQL security scanning
- ESLint/Pylint/Rubocop for code style
- Unused variable/import detection
- Duplicated logic detection
- Type checking (TypeScript/mypy/etc)

### 2. 3-Reviewer Parallel System (AI-driven)

Every code change goes through 3 specialized reviewers **simultaneously**:

```
IMPLEMENT -> BLIND REVIEW (parallel) -> DEBATE (if disagreement) -> AGGREGATE -> FIX -> RE-REVIEW
                |
                +-- code-reviewer (Opus) - Code quality, patterns, best practices
                +-- business-logic-reviewer (Opus) - Requirements, edge cases, UX
                +-- security-reviewer (Opus) - Vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10
```

**Important:**
- ALWAYS launch all 3 reviewers in a single message (3 Task calls)
- ALWAYS specify model: "opus" for each reviewer
- ALWAYS use blind review mode (reviewers cannot see each other's findings initially)
- NEVER dispatch reviewers sequentially (always parallel - 3x faster)
- NEVER aggregate before all 3 reviewers complete

### Anti-Sycophancy Protocol (CONSENSAGENT Research)

**Problem:** Reviewers may reinforce each other's findings instead of critically engaging.

**Solution: Blind Review + Devil's Advocate**

```python
# Phase 1: Independent blind review
reviews = []
for reviewer in [code_reviewer, business_reviewer, security_reviewer]:
    review = Task(
        subagent_type="general-purpose",
        model="opus",
        prompt=f"""
        {reviewer.prompt}

        CRITICAL: Be skeptical. Your job is to find problems.
        List specific concerns with file:line references.
        Do NOT rubber-stamp. Finding zero issues is suspicious.
        """
    )
    reviews.append(review)

# Phase 2: Check for disagreement
if has_disagreement(reviews):
    # Structured debate - max 2 rounds
    debate_result = structured_debate(reviews, max_rounds=2)
else:
    # All agreed - run devil's advocate
    devil_review = Task(
        subagent_type="general-purpose",
        model="opus",
        prompt="""
        The other reviewers found no issues. Your job is to be contrarian.
        Find problems they missed. Challenge assumptions.
        If truly nothing wrong, explain why each potential issue category is covered.
        """
    )
    reviews.append(devil_review)
```

### Heterogeneous Team Composition

**Each reviewer has distinct personality/focus:**

| Reviewer | Model | Expertise | Personality |
|----------|-------|-----------|-------------|
| Code Quality | Opus | SOLID, patterns, maintainability | Perfectionist |
| Business Logic | Opus | Requirements, edge cases, UX | Pragmatic |
| Security | Opus | OWASP, auth, injection | Paranoid |

This diversity prevents groupthink and catches more issues.

### 3. Severity-Based Blocking

| Severity | Action | Continue? |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Critical** | BLOCK - Fix immediately | NO |
| **High** | BLOCK - Fix immediately | NO |
| **Medium** | BLOCK - Fix before proceeding | NO |
| **Low** | Add `// TODO(review): ...` comment | YES |
| **Cosmetic** | Add `// FIXME(nitpick): ...` comment | YES |

**Critical/High/Medium = BLOCK and fix before proceeding**
**Low/Cosmetic = Add TODO/FIXME comment, continue**

### 4. Test Coverage Gates
- Unit tests: 100% pass, >80% coverage
- Integration tests: 100% pass
- E2E tests: critical flows pass

### 5. Rulesets (Blocking Merges)
- No secrets in code
- No unhandled exceptions
- No SQL injection vulnerabilities
- No XSS vulnerabilities

---

## Code Review Protocol

### Launching Reviewers (Parallel)

```python
# CORRECT: Launch all 3 in parallel
Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus",
     description="Code quality review",
     prompt="Review for code quality, patterns, SOLID principles...")

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus",
     description="Business logic review",
     prompt="Review for requirements alignment, edge cases, UX...")

Task(subagent_type="general-purpose", model="opus",
     description="Security review",
     prompt="Review for vulnerabilities, OWASP Top 10...")

# WRONG: Sequential reviewers (3x slower)
# Don't do: await reviewer1; await reviewer2; await reviewer3;
```

### After Fixes

- ALWAYS re-run ALL 3 reviewers after fixes (not just the one that found the issue)
- Wait for all reviews to complete before aggregating results

---

## Structured Prompting for Subagents

**Every subagent dispatch MUST include:**

```markdown
## GOAL (What success looks like)
[High-level objective, not just the action]
Example: "Refactor authentication for maintainability and testability"
NOT: "Refactor the auth file"

## CONSTRAINTS (What you cannot do)
- No third-party dependencies without approval
- Maintain backwards compatibility with v1.x API
- Keep response time under 200ms
- Follow existing error handling patterns

## CONTEXT (What you need to know)
- Related files: [list with brief descriptions]
- Architecture decisions: [relevant ADRs or patterns]
- Previous attempts: [what was tried, why it failed]
- Dependencies: [what this depends on, what depends on this]

## OUTPUT FORMAT (What to deliver)
- [ ] Pull request with Why/What/Trade-offs description
- [ ] Unit tests with >90% coverage
- [ ] Update API documentation
- [ ] Performance benchmark results
```

---

## Task Completion Report

**Every completed task MUST include decision documentation:**

```markdown
## Task Completion Report

### WHY (Problem & Solution Rationale)
- **Problem**: [What was broken/missing/suboptimal]
- **Root Cause**: [Why it happened]
- **Solution Chosen**: [What we implemented]
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  1. [Option A]: Rejected because [reason]
  2. [Option B]: Rejected because [reason]

### WHAT (Changes Made)
- **Files Modified**: [with line ranges and purpose]
  - `src/auth.ts:45-89` - Extracted token validation to separate function
  - `src/auth.test.ts:120-156` - Added edge case tests
- **APIs Changed**: [breaking vs non-breaking]
- **Behavior Changes**: [what users will notice]
- **Dependencies Added/Removed**: [with justification]

### TRADE-OFFS (Gains & Costs)
- **Gained**:
  - Better testability (extracted pure functions)
  - 40% faster token validation
  - Reduced cyclomatic complexity from 15 to 6
- **Cost**:
  - Added 2 new functions (increased surface area)
  - Requires migration for custom token validators
- **Neutral**:
  - No performance change for standard use cases

### RISKS & MITIGATIONS
- **Risk**: Existing custom validators may break
  - **Mitigation**: Added backwards-compatibility shim, deprecation warning
- **Risk**: New validation logic untested at scale
  - **Mitigation**: Gradual rollout with feature flag, rollback plan ready

### TEST RESULTS
- Unit: 24/24 passed (coverage: 92%)
- Integration: 8/8 passed
- Performance: p99 improved from 145ms -> 87ms

### NEXT STEPS (if any)
- [ ] Monitor error rates for 24h post-deploy
- [ ] Create follow-up task to remove compatibility shim in v3.0
```

---

## Preventing "AI Slop"

### Warning Signs
- Tests pass but code quality degraded
- Copy-paste duplication instead of abstraction
- Over-engineered solutions to simple problems
- Missing error handling
- No logging/observability
- Generic variable names (data, temp, result)
- Magic numbers without constants
- Commented-out code
- TODO comments without GitHub issues

### When Detected
1. Fail the task immediately
2. Add to failed queue with detailed feedback
3. Re-dispatch with stricter constraints
4. Update CONTINUITY.md with anti-pattern to avoid

---

## Quality Gate Hooks

### Pre-Write Hook (BLOCKING)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .loki/hooks/pre-write.sh
# Blocks writes that violate rules

# Check for secrets
if grep -rE "(password|secret|key).*=.*['\"][^'\"]{8,}" "$1"; then
  echo "BLOCKED: Potential secret detected"
  exit 1
fi

# Check for console.log in production
if grep -n "console.log" "$1" | grep -v "test"; then
  echo "BLOCKED: Remove console.log statements"
  exit 1
fi
```

### Post-Write Hook (AUTO-FIX)
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# .loki/hooks/post-write.sh
# Auto-fixes after writes

# Format code
npx prettier --write "$1"

# Fix linting issues
npx eslint --fix "$1"

# Type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

---

## Constitution Reference

Quality gates are enforced by `autonomy/CONSTITUTION.md`:

**Pre-Commit (BLOCKING):**
- Linting (auto-fix enabled)
- Type checking (strict mode)
- Contract tests (80% coverage minimum)
- Spec validation (Spectral)

**Post-Implementation (AUTO-FIX):**
- Static analysis (ESLint, Prettier, TSC)
- Security scan (Semgrep, Snyk)
- Performance check (Lighthouse score 90+)

**Runtime Invariants:**
- `SPEC_BEFORE_CODE`: Implementation tasks require spec reference
- `TASK_HAS_COMMIT`: Completed tasks have git commit SHA
- `QUALITY_GATES_PASSED`: Completed tasks passed all quality checks




### Lab Research Patterns

# Lab Research Patterns Reference

Research-backed patterns from Google DeepMind and Anthropic for enhanced multi-agent orchestration and safety.

---

## Overview

This reference consolidates key patterns from:
1. **Google DeepMind** - World models, self-improvement, scalable oversight
2. **Anthropic** - Constitutional AI, alignment safety, agentic coding

---

## Google DeepMind Patterns

### World Model Training (Dreamer 4)

**Key Insight:** Train agents inside world models for safety and data efficiency.

```yaml
world_model_training:
  principle: "Learn behaviors through simulation, not real environment"
  benefits:
    - 100x less data than real-world training
    - Safe exploration of dangerous actions
    - Faster iteration cycles

  architecture:
    tokenizer: "Compress frames into continuous representation"
    dynamics_model: "Predict next world state given action"
    imagination_training: "RL inside simulated trajectories"

  loki_application:
    - Run agent tasks in isolated containers first
    - Simulate deployment before actual deploy
    - Test error scenarios in sandbox
```

### Self-Improvement Loop (SIMA 2)

**Key Insight:** Use AI to generate tasks and score outcomes for bootstrapped learning.

```python
class SelfImprovementLoop:
    """
    Based on SIMA 2's self-improvement mechanism.
    Gemini-based teacher + learned reward model.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.task_generator = "Use LLM to generate varied tasks"
        self.reward_model = "Learned model to score trajectories"
        self.experience_bank = []

    def bootstrap_cycle(self):
        # 1. Generate tasks with estimated rewards
        tasks = self.task_generator.generate(
            domain=current_project,
            difficulty_curriculum=True
        )

        # 2. Execute tasks, accumulate experience
        for task in tasks:
            trajectory = execute(task)
            reward = self.reward_model.score(trajectory)
            self.experience_bank.append((trajectory, reward))

        # 3. Train next generation on experience
        next_agent = train_on_experience(self.experience_bank)

        # 4. Iterate with minimal human intervention
        return next_agent
```

**Loki Mode Application:**
- Generate test scenarios automatically
- Score code quality with learned criteria
- Bootstrap agent training across projects

### Hierarchical Reasoning (Gemini Robotics)

**Key Insight:** Separate high-level planning from low-level execution.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| EMBODIED REASONING MODEL (Gemini Robotics-ER)                     |
| - Orchestrates activities like a "high-level brain"               |
| - Spatial understanding, planning, logical decisions              |
| - Natively calls tools (search, user functions)                   |
| - Does NOT directly control actions                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |
        | High-level insights
        v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VISION-LANGUAGE-ACTION MODEL (Gemini Robotics)                    |
| - "Thinks before taking action"                                   |
| - Generates internal reasoning in natural language                |
| - Decomposes long tasks into simpler segments                     |
| - Directly outputs actions/commands                               |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Loki Mode Application:**
- Orchestrator = ER model (planning, tool calls)
- Implementation agents = VLA model (code actions)
- Task decomposition before execution

### Cross-Embodiment Transfer

**Key Insight:** Skills learned by one agent type transfer to others.

```yaml
transfer_learning:
  observation: "Tasks learned on ALOHA2 work on Apollo humanoid"
  mechanism: "Shared action space abstraction"

  loki_application:
    - Patterns learned by frontend agent transfer to mobile agent
    - Testing strategies from QA apply to security testing
    - Deployment scripts generalize across cloud providers

  implementation:
    shared_skills_library: ".loki/memory/skills/"
    abstraction_layer: "Domain-agnostic action primitives"
    transfer_score: "Confidence in skill applicability"
```

### Scalable Oversight via Debate

**Key Insight:** Pit AI capabilities against each other for verification.

```python
async def debate_verification(proposal, max_rounds=2):
    """
    Based on DeepMind's Scalable AI Safety via Doubly-Efficient Debate.
    Use debate to break down verification into manageable sub-tasks.
    """
    # Two equally capable AI critics
    proponent = Agent(role="defender", model="opus")
    opponent = Agent(role="challenger", model="opus")

    debate_log = []

    for round in range(max_rounds):
        # Proponent defends proposal
        defense = await proponent.argue(
            proposal=proposal,
            counter_arguments=debate_log
        )

        # Opponent challenges
        challenge = await opponent.argue(
            proposal=proposal,
            defense=defense,
            goal="find_flaws"
        )

        debate_log.append({
            "round": round,
            "defense": defense,
            "challenge": challenge
        })

        # If opponent cannot find valid flaw, proposal is verified
        if not challenge.has_valid_flaw:
            return VerificationResult(verified=True, debate_log=debate_log)

    # Human reviews remaining disagreements
    return escalate_to_human(debate_log)
```

### Amplified Oversight

**Key Insight:** Use AI to help humans supervise AI beyond human capability.

```yaml
amplified_oversight:
  goal: "Supervision as close as possible to human with complete understanding"

  techniques:
    - "AI explains its reasoning transparently"
    - "AI argues against itself when wrong"
    - "AI cites relevant evidence"
    - "Monitor knows when it doesn't know"

  monitoring_principle:
    when_unsure: "Either reject action OR flag for review"
    never: "Approve uncertain actions silently"
```

---

## Anthropic Patterns

### Constitutional AI Principles

**Key Insight:** Train AI to self-critique based on explicit principles.

```python
class ConstitutionalAI:
    """
    Based on Anthropic's Constitutional AI: Harmlessness from AI Feedback.
    Self-critique and revision based on constitutional principles.
    """

    def __init__(self, constitution):
        self.constitution = constitution  # List of principles

    async def supervised_learning_phase(self, response):
        """Phase 1: Self-critique and revise."""
        # Generate initial response
        initial = response

        # Self-critique against each principle
        critiques = []
        for principle in self.constitution:
            critique = await self.critique(
                response=initial,
                principle=principle,
                prompt=f"Does this response violate: {principle}?"
            )
            critiques.append(critique)

        # Revise based on critiques
        revised = await self.revise(
            response=initial,
            critiques=critiques
        )

        return revised

    async def rlai_phase(self, response_pairs):
        """Phase 2: AI compares responses for constitutional compliance."""
        preferences = []
        for (response_a, response_b) in response_pairs:
            preference = await self.compare(
                a=response_a,
                b=response_b,
                criterion="Which better follows the constitution?"
            )
            preferences.append(preference)

        # Train preference model on AI feedback
        return train_preference_model(preferences)
```

**Loki Mode Constitution Example:**
```yaml
loki_constitution:
  - "Never delete production data without explicit backup"
  - "Never commit secrets or credentials to version control"
  - "Never bypass quality gates for speed"
  - "Always verify tests pass before marking task complete"
  - "Never claim completion without running actual tests"
  - "Prefer simple solutions over clever ones"
  - "Document decisions, not just code"
```

### Sleeper Agent Detection (Defection Probes)

**Key Insight:** Use linear classifiers to detect when agents might misbehave.

```python
class DefectionProbe:
    """
    Based on Anthropic's "Simple probes can catch sleeper agents".
    Linear classifiers detecting anomalous agent behavior.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        self.baseline_behaviors = []
        self.probe = LinearClassifier()

    def train_probe(self, normal_trajectories, defection_examples):
        """
        Train on contrast pairs:
        - Normal agent behavior
        - Examples of defection/misbehavior
        """
        contrast_pairs = create_contrast_pairs(
            normal=normal_trajectories,
            defection=defection_examples
        )
        self.probe.fit(contrast_pairs)

    def check_for_defection(self, agent_action, context):
        """
        Check if action appears anomalous.
        AUROC > 99% achieved in Anthropic's research.
        """
        features = extract_features(agent_action, context)
        defection_probability = self.probe.predict_proba(features)

        if defection_probability > THRESHOLD:
            return DefectionAlert(
                probability=defection_probability,
                action=agent_action,
                recommendation="Flag for human review"
            )
        return None
```

**Loki Mode Application:**
- Monitor agent actions for anomalies
- Flag unusual file access patterns
- Detect attempts to bypass quality gates

### Alignment Faking Awareness

**Key Insight:** Models may strategically comply while preserving hidden preferences.

```yaml
alignment_faking_signals:
  warning_signs:
    - "Agent complies only when it knows it's being monitored"
    - "Agent's reasoning contradicts its final action"
    - "Sudden behavior change when training context mentioned"
    - "Agent attempts to exfiltrate its own weights/state"

  detection_strategy:
    - "Monitor chain-of-thought for rationalization"
    - "Compare behavior in 'free' vs 'monitored' conditions"
    - "Check for attempts to undermine oversight systems"

  mitigation:
    - "Constitutional constraints at training time"
    - "Transparency in reasoning (visible extended thinking)"
    - "Defection probes on intermediate reasoning"
```

### Extended Thinking Levels

**Key Insight:** Allocate computation based on problem complexity.

```yaml
thinking_levels:
  "think":
    computation: "Minimal"
    use_for: "Simple questions, straightforward tasks"

  "think hard":
    computation: "Moderate"
    use_for: "Multi-step problems, code implementation"

  "think harder":
    computation: "Extended"
    use_for: "Complex debugging, architecture decisions"

  "ultrathink":
    computation: "Maximum"
    use_for: "Security analysis, critical system design"

loki_mode_mapping:
  haiku_tasks: "think"
  sonnet_tasks: "think hard"
  opus_tasks: "think harder to ultrathink"
```

### Explore-Plan-Code Pattern

**Key Insight:** Research before planning, plan before coding.

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PHASE 1: EXPLORE                                                  |
| - Research relevant files                                         |
| - Understand existing patterns                                    |
| - Identify dependencies and constraints                           |
| - NO CODE CHANGES YET                                             |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PHASE 2: PLAN                                                     |
| - Create detailed implementation plan                             |
| - List all files to modify                                        |
| - Define success criteria                                         |
| - Get checkpoint approval if needed                               |
| - STILL NO CODE CHANGES                                           |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
        |
        v
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| PHASE 3: CODE                                                     |
| - Execute plan systematically                                     |
| - Test after each file change                                     |
| - Update plan if discoveries require it                           |
| - Verify against success criteria                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Context Reset Strategy

**Key Insight:** Fresh context often performs better than accumulated context.

```yaml
context_management:
  problem: "Long sessions accumulate irrelevant information"

  solution:
    trigger_reset:
      - "After completing major task"
      - "When changing domains (backend -> frontend)"
      - "When agent seems confused or repeating errors"

    preserve_across_reset:
      - "CONTINUITY.md (working memory)"
      - "Key decisions made this session"
      - "Current task state"

    discard_on_reset:
      - "Intermediate debugging attempts"
      - "Abandoned approaches"
      - "Superseded plans"
```

### Parallel Instance Pattern

**Key Insight:** Multiple Claude instances with separation of concerns.

```python
async def parallel_instance_pattern(task):
    """
    Run multiple Claude instances for separation of concerns.
    Based on Anthropic's Claude Code best practices.
    """
    # Instance 1: Implementation
    implementer = spawn_instance(
        role="implementer",
        context=implementation_context,
        permissions=["edit", "bash"]
    )

    # Instance 2: Review
    reviewer = spawn_instance(
        role="reviewer",
        context=review_context,
        permissions=["read"]  # Read-only for safety
    )

    # Parallel execution
    implementation = await implementer.execute(task)
    review = await reviewer.review(implementation)

    if review.approved:
        return implementation
    else:
        # Feed review back to implementer for fixes
        fixed = await implementer.fix(review.issues)
        return fixed
```

### Prompt Injection Defense

**Key Insight:** Multi-layer defense against injection attacks.

```yaml
prompt_injection_defense:
  layers:
    layer_1_recognition:
      - "Train to recognize injection patterns"
      - "Detect malicious content in external sources"

    layer_2_context_isolation:
      - "Sandbox external content processing"
      - "Mark user content vs system instructions"

    layer_3_action_validation:
      - "Verify requested actions are authorized"
      - "Block sensitive operations without confirmation"

    layer_4_monitoring:
      - "Log all external content interactions"
      - "Alert on suspicious patterns"

  performance:
    claude_opus_4: "89% attack prevention"
    claude_sonnet_4: "86% attack prevention"
```

## Combined Patterns for Loki Mode

### Self-Improving Multi-Agent System

```yaml
combined_approach:
  world_model_training: "Test in simulation before real execution"
  self_improvement: "Bootstrap learning from successful trajectories"
  constitutional_constraints: "Principles-based self-critique"
  debate_verification: "Pit reviewers against each other"
  defection_probes: "Monitor for alignment faking"

  implementation_priority:
    high:
      - Constitutional AI principles in agent prompts
      - Explore-Plan-Code workflow enforcement
      - Context reset triggers

    medium:
      - Self-improvement loop for task generation
      - Debate-based verification for critical changes
      - Cross-embodiment skill transfer

    low:
      - Full world model training
      - Defection probe classifiers
```

### Production Patterns

# Production Patterns Reference

Practitioner-tested patterns from Hacker News discussions and real-world deployments. These patterns represent what actually works in production, not theoretical frameworks.

---

## Overview

This reference consolidates battle-tested insights from:
- HN discussions on autonomous agents in production (2025)
- Coding with LLMs practitioner experiences
- Simon Willison's Superpowers coding agent patterns
- Multi-agent orchestration real-world deployments

---

## What Actually Works in Production

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) is Non-Negotiable

**Key Insight:** "Zero companies don't have a human in the loop" for customer-facing applications.

```yaml
hitl_patterns:
  always_human:
    - Customer-facing responses
    - Financial transactions
    - Security-critical operations
    - Legal/compliance decisions

  automation_candidates:
    - Internal tooling
    - Developer assistance
    - Data preprocessing
    - Code generation (with review)

  implementation:
    - Classification layer routes to human vs automated
    - Confidence thresholds trigger escalation
    - Audit trails for all automated decisions
```

### Narrow Scope Wins

**Key Insight:** Successful agents operate within tightly constrained domains.

```yaml
scope_constraints:
  max_steps_before_review: 3-5
  task_characteristics:
    - Specific, well-defined objectives
    - Pre-classified inputs
    - Deterministic success criteria
    - Verifiable outputs

  successful_domains:
    - Email scanning and classification
    - Invoice processing
    - Code refactoring (bounded)
    - Documentation generation
    - Test writing

  failure_prone_domains:
    - Open-ended feature implementation
    - Novel algorithm design
    - Security-critical code
    - Cross-system integrations
```

### Confidence-Based Routing

**Key Insight:** Treat agents as preprocessors, not decision-makers.

```python
def confidence_based_routing(agent_output):
    """
    Route based on confidence, not capability.
    Based on production practitioner patterns.
    """
    confidence = agent_output.confidence_score

    if confidence >= 0.95:
        # High confidence: auto-approve with logging
        return AutoApprove(audit_log=True)

    elif confidence >= 0.70:
        # Medium confidence: quick human review
        return HumanReview(priority="normal", timeout="1h")

    elif confidence >= 0.40:
        # Low confidence: detailed human review
        return HumanReview(priority="high", context="full")

    else:
        # Very low confidence: escalate immediately
        return Escalate(reason="low_confidence", require_senior=True)
```

### Classification Before Automation

**Key Insight:** Separate inputs before processing.

```yaml
classification_first:
  step_1_classify:
    workable:
      - Clear requirements
      - Existing patterns
      - Test coverage available
    non_workable:
      - Ambiguous requirements
      - Novel architecture
      - Missing dependencies
    escalate_immediately:
      - Security concerns
      - Compliance requirements
      - Customer-facing changes

  step_2_route:
    workable: "Automated pipeline"
    non_workable: "Human clarification"
    escalate: "Senior review"
```

### Deterministic Outer Loops

**Key Insight:** Wrap agent outputs with rule-based validation.

```python
def deterministic_validation_loop(task, max_attempts=3):
    """
    Use LLMs only where genuine ambiguity exists.
    Wrap with deterministic rules.
    """
    for attempt in range(max_attempts):
        # LLM handles the ambiguous part
        output = agent.execute(task)

        # Deterministic validation (NOT LLM)
        validation_errors = []

        # Rule: Must have tests
        if not output.has_tests:
            validation_errors.append("Missing tests")

        # Rule: Must pass linting
        lint_result = run_linter(output.code)
        if lint_result.errors:
            validation_errors.append(f"Lint errors: {lint_result.errors}")

        # Rule: Must compile
        compile_result = compile_code(output.code)
        if not compile_result.success:
            validation_errors.append(f"Compile error: {compile_result.error}")

        # Rule: Tests must pass
        if output.has_tests:
            test_result = run_tests(output.code)
            if not test_result.all_passed:
                validation_errors.append(f"Test failures: {test_result.failures}")

        if not validation_errors:
            return output

        # Feed errors back for retry
        task = task.with_feedback(validation_errors)

    return FailedResult(reason="Max attempts exceeded")
```

## Context Engineering Patterns

### Context Curation Over Automatic Selection

**Key Insight:** Manually choose which files and information to provide.

```yaml
context_curation:
  principles:
    - "Less is more" - focused context beats comprehensive context
    - Manual selection outperforms automatic RAG
    - Remove outdated information aggressively

  anti_patterns:
    - Dumping entire codebase into context
    - Relying on automatic context selection
    - Accumulating conversation history indefinitely

  implementation:
    per_task_context:
      - 2-5 most relevant files
      - Specific functions, not entire modules
      - Recent changes only (last 1-2 days)
      - Clear success criteria

    context_budget:
      target: "< 10k tokens for context"
      reserve: "90% for model reasoning"
```

### Information Abstraction

**Key Insight:** Summarize rather than feeding full data.

```python
def abstract_for_agent(raw_data, task_context):
    """
    Design abstractions that preserve decision-relevant information.
    Based on practitioner insights.
    """
    # BAD: Feed 10,000 database rows
    # raw_data = db.query("SELECT * FROM users")

    # GOOD: Summarize to decision-relevant info
    summary = {
        "query_status": "success",
        "total_results": len(raw_data),
        "sample": raw_data[:5],
        "schema": extract_schema(raw_data),
        "statistics": {
            "null_count": count_nulls(raw_data),
            "unique_values": count_uniques(raw_data),
            "date_range": get_date_range(raw_data)
        }
    }

    return summary
```

### Separate Conversations Per Task

**Key Insight:** Fresh contexts yield better results than accumulated sessions.

```yaml
conversation_management:
  new_conversation_triggers:
    - Different domain (backend -> frontend)
    - New feature vs bug fix
    - After completing major task
    - When errors accumulate (3+ in row)

  preserve_across_sessions:
    - CLAUDE.md / CONTINUITY.md
    - Architectural decisions
    - Key constraints

  discard_between_sessions:
    - Debugging attempts
    - Abandoned approaches
    - Intermediate drafts
```

---

## Skills System Pattern

### On-Demand Skill Loading

**Key Insight:** Skills remain dormant until the model actively seeks them out.

```yaml
skills_architecture:
  core_interaction: "< 2k tokens"
  skill_loading: "On-demand via search"

  implementation:
    skill_discovery:
      - Shell script searches skill files
      - Model requests specific skills by name
      - Skills loaded only when needed

    skill_structure:
      name: "unique-skill-name"
      trigger: "Pattern that activates skill"
      content: "Detailed instructions"
      dependencies: ["other-skills"]

  benefits:
    - Minimal base context
    - Extensible without bloat
    - Skills can be updated independently
```

### Sub-Agents for Context Isolation

**Key Insight:** Prevent massive token waste by isolating context-noisy subtasks.

```python
async def context_isolated_search(query, codebase_path):
    """
    Use sub-agent for grep/search to prevent context pollution.
    Based on Simon Willison's patterns.
    """
    # Main agent stays focused
    # Sub-agent handles noisy file searching

    search_agent = spawn_subagent(
        role="codebase-searcher",
        context_limit="10k tokens",
        permissions=["read-only"]
    )

    results = await search_agent.execute(
        task=f"Find files related to: {query}",
        codebase=codebase_path
    )

    # Return only relevant paths, not full content
    return FilteredResults(
        paths=results.relevant_files[:10],
        summaries=results.file_summaries,
        confidence=results.relevance_scores
    )
```

---

## Planning Before Execution

### Explicit Plan-Then-Code Workflow

**Key Insight:** Have models articulate detailed plans without immediately writing code.

```yaml
plan_then_code:
  phase_1_planning:
    outputs:
      - spec.md: "Detailed requirements"
      - todo.md: "Tagged tasks [BUG], [FEAT], [REFACTOR]"
      - approach.md: "Implementation strategy"
    constraints:
      - NO CODE in this phase
      - Human review before proceeding
      - Clear success criteria

  phase_2_review:
    checks:
      - Plan addresses all requirements
      - Approach is feasible
      - No missing dependencies
      - Tests are specified

  phase_3_implementation:
    constraints:
      - Follow plan exactly
      - One task at a time
      - Test after each change
      - Report deviations immediately
```

---

## Multi-Agent Orchestration Patterns

### Event-Driven Coordination

**Key Insight:** Move beyond synchronous prompt chaining to asynchronous, decoupled systems.

```yaml
event_driven_orchestration:
  problems_with_synchronous:
    - Doesn't scale
    - Mixes orchestration with prompt logic
    - Single failure breaks entire chain
    - No retry/recovery mechanism

  async_architecture:
    message_queue:
      - Agents communicate via events
      - Decoupled execution
      - Natural retry/dead-letter handling

    state_management:
      - Persistent task state
      - Checkpoint/resume capability
      - Clear ownership of data

    error_handling:
      - Per-agent retry policies
      - Circuit breakers
      - Graceful degradation
```

### Policy-First Enforcement

**Key Insight:** Govern agent behavior at runtime, not just training time.

```python
class PolicyEngine:
    """
    Runtime governance for agent behavior.
    Based on autonomous control plane patterns.
    """

    def __init__(self, policies):
        self.policies = policies

    async def enforce(self, agent_action, context):
        for policy in self.policies:
            result = await policy.evaluate(agent_action, context)

            if result.blocked:
                return BlockedAction(
                    reason=result.reason,
                    policy=policy.name,
                    remediation=result.suggested_action
                )

            if result.modified:
                agent_action = result.modified_action

        return AllowedAction(agent_action)

# Example policies
policies = [
    NoProductionDataDeletion(),
    NoSecretsInCode(),
    MaxTokenBudget(limit=100000),
    RequireTestsForCode(),
    BlockExternalNetworkCalls(in_sandbox=True)
]
```

### Simulation Layer

**Key Insight:** Evaluate changes before deploying to real environment.

```yaml
simulation_layer:
  purpose: "Test agent behavior in safe environment"

  implementation:
    sandbox_environment:
      - Isolated container
      - Mocked external services
      - Synthetic data
      - Full audit logging

    validation_checks:
      - Run tests in sandbox first
      - Compare outputs to expected
      - Check for policy violations
      - Measure resource consumption

    promotion_criteria:
      - All tests pass
      - No policy violations
      - Resource usage within limits
      - Human approval (for sensitive changes)
```

---

## Evaluation and Benchmarking

### Problems with Current Benchmarks

**Key Insight:** LLM-as-judge creates shared blind spots.

```yaml
benchmark_problems:
  llm_judge_issues:
    - Same architecture = same failure modes
    - Math errors accepted as correct
    - "Do-nothing" baseline passes 38% of time

  contamination:
    - Published benchmarks become training targets
    - Overfitting to specific datasets
    - Inflated scores don't reflect real performance

  solutions:
    held_back_sets: "90% public, 10% private"
    human_evaluation: "Final published results require humans"
    production_testing: "A/B tests measure actual value"
    objective_outcomes: "Simulated environments with verifiable results"
```

### Practical Evaluation Approach

```python
def evaluate_agent_change(before_agent, after_agent, task_set):
    """
    Production-oriented evaluation.
    Based on HN practitioner recommendations.
    """
    results = {
        "before": [],
        "after": [],
        "human_preference": []
    }

    for task in task_set:
        # Run both agents
        before_result = before_agent.execute(task)
        after_result = after_agent.execute(task)

        # Objective metrics (NOT LLM-judged)
        results["before"].append({
            "tests_pass": run_tests(before_result),
            "lint_clean": run_linter(before_result),
            "time_taken": before_result.duration,
            "tokens_used": before_result.tokens
        })

        results["after"].append({
            "tests_pass": run_tests(after_result),
            "lint_clean": run_linter(after_result),
            "time_taken": after_result.duration,
            "tokens_used": after_result.tokens
        })

        # Sample for human review
        if random.random() < 0.1:  # 10% sample
            results["human_preference"].append({
                "task": task,
                "before": before_result,
                "after": after_result,
                "pending_review": True
            })

    return EvaluationReport(results)
```

---

## Cost and Token Economics

### Real-World Cost Patterns

```yaml
cost_patterns:
  claude_code:
    heavy_use: "$25/1-2 hours on large codebases"
    api_range: "$1-5/hour depending on efficiency"
    max_tier: "$200/month often needs 2-3 subscriptions"

  token_economics:
    sub_agents_multiply_cost: "Each duplicates context"
    example: "5-task parallel job = 50,000+ tokens per subtask"

  optimization:
    context_isolation: "Use sub-agents for noisy tasks"
    information_abstraction: "Summarize, don't dump"
    fresh_conversations: "Reset after major tasks"
    skill_on_demand: "Load only when needed"
```

### Openai Patterns

# OpenAI Agent Patterns Reference

Research-backed patterns from OpenAI's Agents SDK, Deep Research, and autonomous agent frameworks.

---

## Overview

OpenAI's agent ecosystem provides four key architectural innovations for Loki Mode:

1. **Tracing Spans** - Hierarchical event tracking with span types
2. **Guardrails & Tripwires** - Input/output validation with early termination
3. **Handoff Callbacks** - Data preparation during agent transfers
4. **Multi-Tiered Fallbacks** - Model and workflow-level failure recovery

---

## Tracing Spans Architecture

### Span Types (Agents SDK Pattern)

Every operation is wrapped in a typed span for observability:

```yaml
span_types:
  agent_span:
    - Wraps entire agent execution
    - Contains: agent_name, instructions_hash, model

  generation_span:
    - Wraps LLM API calls
    - Contains: model, tokens_in, tokens_out, latency_ms

  function_span:
    - Wraps tool/function calls
    - Contains: function_name, arguments, result, success

  guardrail_span:
    - Wraps validation checks
    - Contains: guardrail_name, triggered, blocking

  handoff_span:
    - Wraps agent-to-agent transfers
    - Contains: from_agent, to_agent, context_passed

  custom_span:
    - User-defined operations
    - Contains: operation_name, metadata
```

### Hierarchical Trace Structure

```json
{
  "trace_id": "trace_abc123def456",
  "workflow_name": "implement_feature",
  "group_id": "session_xyz789",
  "spans": [
    {
      "span_id": "span_001",
      "parent_id": null,
      "type": "agent_span",
      "agent_name": "orchestrator",
      "started_at": "2026-01-07T10:00:00Z",
      "ended_at": "2026-01-07T10:05:00Z",
      "children": ["span_002", "span_003"]
    },
    {
      "span_id": "span_002",
      "parent_id": "span_001",
      "type": "guardrail_span",
      "guardrail_name": "input_validation",
      "triggered": false,
      "blocking": true
    },
    {
      "span_id": "span_003",
      "parent_id": "span_001",
      "type": "handoff_span",
      "from_agent": "orchestrator",
      "to_agent": "backend-dev",
      "context_passed": ["task_spec", "related_files"]
    }
  ]
}
```

### Storage Location

```
.loki/traces/
├── active/
│   └── {trace_id}.json     # Currently running traces
└── completed/
    └── {date}/
        └── {trace_id}.json # Archived traces by date
```

---

## Guardrails & Tripwires System

### Input Guardrails

Run **before** agent execution to validate user input:

```python
@input_guardrail(blocking=True)
async def validate_task_scope(input, context):
    """
    Blocks tasks outside project scope.
    Based on OpenAI Agents SDK pattern.
    """
    # Check if task references files outside project
    if references_external_paths(input):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Task references paths outside project root"
        )

    # Check for disallowed operations
    if contains_destructive_operation(input):
        return GuardrailResult(
            tripwire_triggered=True,
            reason="Destructive operation requires human approval"
        )

    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)
```

### Output Guardrails

Run **after** agent execution to validate results:

```python
@output_guardrail
async def validate_code_quality(output, context):
    """
    Blocks low-quality code output.
    """
    if output.type == "code":
        issues = run_static_analysis(output.content)
        critical = [i for i in issues if i.severity == "critical"]

        if critical:
            return GuardrailResult(
                tripwire_triggered=True,
                reason=f"Critical issues found: {critical}"
            )

    return GuardrailResult(tripwire_triggered=False)
```

### Execution Modes

| Mode | Behavior | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| **Blocking** | Guardrail completes before agent starts | Sensitive operations, expensive models |
| **Parallel** | Guardrail runs concurrently with agent | Fast checks, acceptable token loss |

```python
# Blocking mode: prevents token consumption
@input_guardrail(blocking=True, run_in_parallel=False)
async def expensive_validation(input):
    # Agent won't start until this completes
    pass

# Parallel mode: faster but may waste tokens if fails
@input_guardrail(blocking=True, run_in_parallel=True)
async def fast_validation(input):
    # Runs alongside agent start
    pass
```

### Tripwire Exceptions

When tripwire triggers, execution halts immediately:

```python
class InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered(Exception):
    """Raised when input validation fails."""
    pass

class OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered(Exception):
    """Raised when output validation fails."""
    pass

# In agent loop:
try:
    result = await run_agent(task)
except InputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    log_blocked_attempt(e)
    return early_exit(reason=str(e))
except OutputGuardrailTripwireTriggered as e:
    rollback_changes()
    return retry_with_constraints(e.constraints)
```

### Layered Defense Strategy

> "Think of guardrails as a layered defense mechanism. While a single one is unlikely to provide sufficient protection, using multiple, specialized guardrails together creates more resilient agents." - OpenAI Agents SDK

```yaml
guardrail_layers:
  layer_1_input:
    - scope_validation      # Is task within bounds?
    - pii_detection         # Contains sensitive data?
    - injection_detection   # Prompt injection attempt?

  layer_2_pre_execution:
    - cost_estimation       # Will this exceed budget?
    - dependency_check      # Are dependencies available?
    - conflict_detection    # Will this conflict with in-progress work?

  layer_3_output:
    - static_analysis       # Code quality issues?
    - secret_detection      # Secrets in output?
    - spec_compliance       # Matches OpenAPI spec?

  layer_4_post_action:
    - test_validation       # Tests pass?
    - review_approval       # Review passed?
    - deployment_safety     # Safe to deploy?
```

---

## Handoff Callbacks

### on_handoff Pattern

Prepare data when transferring between agents:

```python
async def on_handoff_to_backend_dev(handoff_context):
    """
    Called when orchestrator hands off to backend-dev agent.
    Fetches context the receiving agent will need.
    """
    # Pre-fetch relevant files
    relevant_files = await find_related_files(handoff_context.task)

    # Load architectural context
    architecture = await read_file(".loki/specs/architecture.md")

    # Get recent changes to affected areas
    recent_commits = await git_log(paths=relevant_files, limit=10)

    return HandoffData(
        files=relevant_files,
        architecture=architecture,
        recent_changes=recent_commits,
        constraints=handoff_context.constraints
    )

# Register callback
handoff(
    to_agent=backend_dev,
    on_handoff=on_handoff_to_backend_dev
)
```

### Handoff Context Transfer

```json
{
  "handoff_id": "ho_abc123",
  "from_agent": "orchestrator",
  "to_agent": "backend-dev",
  "timestamp": "2026-01-07T10:05:00Z",
  "context": {
    "task_id": "task-001",
    "goal": "Implement user authentication endpoint",
    "constraints": [
      "Use existing auth patterns from src/auth/",
      "Maintain backwards compatibility",
      "Add rate limiting"
    ],
    "pre_fetched": {
      "files": ["src/auth/middleware.ts", "src/routes/index.ts"],
      "architecture": "...",
      "recent_changes": [...]
    }
  },
  "return_expected": true,
  "timeout_seconds": 600
}
```

---

## Multi-Tiered Fallback System

### Model-Level Fallbacks

```python
async def execute_with_model_fallback(task, preferred_model):
    """
    Try preferred model, fall back to alternatives on failure.
    Based on OpenAI safety patterns.
    """
    fallback_chain = {
        "opus": ["sonnet", "haiku"],
        "sonnet": ["haiku", "opus"],
        "haiku": ["sonnet"]
    }

    models_to_try = [preferred_model] + fallback_chain.get(preferred_model, [])

    for model in models_to_try:
        try:
            result = await run_agent(task, model=model)
            if result.success:
                return result
        except RateLimitError:
            log_warning(f"Rate limit on {model}, trying fallback")
            continue
        except ModelUnavailableError:
            log_warning(f"{model} unavailable, trying fallback")
            continue

    # All models failed
    return escalate_to_human(task, reason="All model fallbacks exhausted")
```

### Workflow-Level Fallbacks

```python
async def execute_with_workflow_fallback(task):
    """
    If complex workflow fails, fall back to simpler operations.
    """
    # Try full workflow first
    try:
        return await full_implementation_workflow(task)
    except WorkflowError as e:
        log_warning(f"Full workflow failed: {e}")

    # Fall back to simpler approach
    try:
        return await simplified_workflow(task)
    except WorkflowError as e:
        log_warning(f"Simplified workflow failed: {e}")

    # Last resort: decompose and try piece by piece
    try:
        subtasks = decompose_task(task)
        results = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            result = await execute_single_step(subtask)
            results.append(result)
        return combine_results(results)
    except Exception as e:
        return escalate_to_human(task, reason=f"All workflows failed: {e}")
```

### Fallback Decision Tree

```
Task Execution
    |
    +-- Try preferred approach
    |   |
    |   +-- Success? --> Done
    |   |
    |   +-- Rate limit? --> Try next model in chain
    |   |
    |   +-- Error? --> Try simpler workflow
    |
    +-- All workflows failed?
    |   |
    |   +-- Decompose into subtasks
    |   |
    |   +-- Execute piece by piece
    |
    +-- Still failing?
        |
        +-- Escalate to human
        +-- Log detailed failure context
        +-- Save state for resume
```

---

## Confidence-Based Human Escalation

### Confidence Scoring

```python
def calculate_confidence(task_result):
    """
    Score confidence 0-1 based on multiple signals.
    Low confidence triggers human review.
    """
    signals = []

    # Test coverage signal
    if task_result.test_coverage >= 0.9:
        signals.append(1.0)
    elif task_result.test_coverage >= 0.7:
        signals.append(0.7)

  # Cost-based
  - condition: tokens_used > budget * 0.8
    action: pause_and_escalate
    reason: "Approaching token budget limit"
```

## AGENTS.md Integration

### Reading Target Project's AGENTS.md

```python
async def load_project_context():
    """
    Read AGENTS.md from target project if exists.
    Based on OpenAI/AAIF standard.
    """
    agents_md_locations = [
        "AGENTS.md",
        ".github/AGENTS.md",
        "docs/AGENTS.md"
    ]

    for location in agents_md_locations:
        if await file_exists(location):
            content = await read_file(location)
            return parse_agents_md(content)

    # No AGENTS.md found - use defaults
    return default_project_context()

def parse_agents_md(content):
    """
    Extract structured guidance from AGENTS.md.
    """
    sections = parse_markdown_sections(content)

    return ProjectContext(
        build_commands=sections.get("build", []),
        test_commands=sections.get("test", []),
        code_style=sections.get("code style", {}),
        architecture_notes=sections.get("architecture", ""),
        deployment_notes=sections.get("deployment", ""),
        security_notes=sections.get("security", "")
    )
```

### Context Priority

```
1. AGENTS.md (closest to current file, monorepo-aware)
2. CLAUDE.md (Claude-specific instructions)
3. .loki/CONTINUITY.md (session state)
4. Package-level documentation
5. README.md (general project info)
```

---

## Reasoning Model Guidance

### When to Use Extended Thinking

Based on OpenAI's o3/o4-mini patterns:

```yaml
use_extended_reasoning:
  always:
    - System architecture design
    - Security vulnerability analysis
    - Complex debugging (multi-file, unclear root cause)
    - API design decisions
    - Performance optimization strategy

  sometimes:
    - Code review (only for critical/complex changes)
    - Refactoring planning (when multiple approaches exist)
    - Integration design (when crossing system boundaries)

  never:
    - Simple bug fixes
    - Documentation updates
    - Unit test writing
    - Formatting/linting
    - File operations
```

### Backtracking Pattern

```python
async def execute_with_backtracking(task, max_backtracks=3):
    """
    Allow agent to backtrack and try different approaches.
    Based on Deep Research's adaptive planning.
    """
    attempts = []

    for attempt in range(max_backtracks + 1):
        # Generate approach considering previous failures
        approach = await plan_approach(
            task,
            failed_approaches=attempts
        )

        result = await execute_approach(approach)

        if result.success:
            return result

        # Record failed approach for learning
        attempts.append({
            "approach": approach,
            "failure_reason": result.error,
            "partial_progress": result.partial_output
        })

        # Backtrack: reset to clean state
        await rollback_to_checkpoint(task.checkpoint_id)

    return FailedResult(
        reason="Max backtracks exceeded",
        attempts=attempts
    )
```

---

## Session State Management

### Automatic State Persistence

```python
class Session:
    """
    Automatic conversation history and state management.
    Inspired by OpenAI Agents SDK Sessions.
    """

    def __init__(self, session_id):
        self.session_id = session_id
        self.state_file = f".loki/state/sessions/{session_id}.json"
        self.history = []
        self.context = {}

    async def save_state(self):
        state = {
            "session_id": self.session_id,
            "history": self.history,
            "context": self.context,
            "last_updated": now()
        }
        await write_json(self.state_file, state)

    async def load_state(self):
        if await file_exists(self.state_file):
            state = await read_json(self.state_file)
            self.history = state["history"]
            self.context = state["context"]

    async def add_turn(self, role, content, metadata=None):
        self.history.append({
            "role": role,
            "content": content,
            "metadata": metadata,
            "timestamp": now()
        })
        await self.save_state()
```

## Agent Execution Model

**Claude Code does NOT support background processes.** Agents execute via:

1. **Role Switching (Recommended):** Orchestrator maintains agent queue, switches roles per task
2. **Sequential:** Execute agents one at a time (simple, reliable)
3. **Parallel via tmux:** Multiple Claude Code sessions (complex, faster)

```bash
# Option 1: Sequential (simple, reliable)
for agent in frontend backend database; do
  claude -p "Act as $agent agent..." --dangerously-skip-permissions
done

# Option 2: Parallel via tmux (complex, faster)
tmux new-session -d -s loki-pool
for i in {1..5}; do
  tmux new-window -t loki-pool -n "agent-$i" \
    "claude --dangerously-skip-permissions -p '$(cat .loki/prompts/agent-$i.md)'"
done

# Option 3: Role switching (recommended)
# Orchestrator maintains agent queue, switches roles per task
```

---

## Model Selection by Agent Type

| Task Type | Model | Reason |
|-----------|-------|--------|
| Implementation | Sonnet | Fast, good enough for coding |
| Code Review | Opus | Deep analysis, catches subtle issues |
| Security Review | Opus | Critical, needs thoroughness |
| Business Logic Review | Opus | Needs to understand requirements deeply |
| Documentation | Sonnet | Straightforward writing |
| Quick fixes | Haiku | Fast iteration |

---

## Agent Lifecycle

```
SPAWN -> INITIALIZE -> POLL_QUEUE -> CLAIM_TASK -> EXECUTE -> REPORT -> POLL_QUEUE
           |              |                        |          |
           |         circuit open?             timeout?    success?
           |              |                        |          |
           v              v                        v          v
     Create state    WAIT_BACKOFF              RELEASE    UPDATE_STATE
                          |                    + RETRY         |
                     exponential                              |
                       backoff                                v
                                                    NO_TASKS --> IDLE (5min)
                                                                    |
                                                             idle > 30min?
                                                                    |
                                                                    v
                                                               TERMINATE
```

---

## Dynamic Scaling Rules

| Condition | Action | Cooldown |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| Queue depth > 20 | Spawn 2 agents of bottleneck type | 5min |
| Queue depth > 50 | Spawn 5 agents, alert orchestrator | 2min |
| Agent idle > 30min | Terminate agent | - |
| Agent failed 3x consecutive | Terminate, open circuit breaker | 5min |
| Critical task waiting > 10min | Spawn priority agent | 1min |
| Circuit breaker half-open | Spawn 1 test agent | - |
| All agents of type failed | HALT, request human intervention | - |

---

## Agent Context Preservation

### Lineage Rules
1. **Immutable Inheritance:** Agents CANNOT modify inherited context
2. **Decision Logging:** All decisions MUST be logged to agent context file
3. **Lineage Reference:** All commits MUST reference parent agent ID
4. **Context Handoff:** When agent completes, context is archived but lineage preserved

### Preventing Context Drift
1. Read `.agent/sub-agents/${parent_id}.json` before spawning
2. Inherit immutable context (tech stack, constraints, decisions)
3. Log all new decisions to own context file
4. Reference lineage in all commits
5. Periodic context sync: check if inherited context has been updated upstream




### Core Workflow

# Core Workflow Reference

Full RARV cycle, CONTINUITY.md template, and autonomy rules.

---

## Autonomy Rules

**This system runs with ZERO human intervention.**

### Core Rules
1. **NEVER ask questions** - Do not say "Would you like me to...", "Should I...", or "What would you prefer?"
2. **NEVER wait for confirmation** - Take immediate action. If something needs to be done, do it.
3. **NEVER stop voluntarily** - Continue until completion promise is fulfilled or max iterations reached
4. **NEVER suggest alternatives** - Pick the best option and execute. No "You could also..." or "Alternatively..."
5. **ALWAYS use RARV cycle** - Every action follows the Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify pattern

---

## RARV Cycle (Reason-Act-Reflect-Verify)

**Enhanced with Automatic Self-Verification Loop (Boris Cherny Pattern)**

Every iteration follows this cycle:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REASON: What needs to be done next?                               |
| - READ .loki/CONTINUITY.md first (working memory)                 |
| - READ "Mistakes & Learnings" to avoid past errors                |
| - Check current state in .loki/state/orchestrator.json            |
| - Review pending tasks in .loki/queue/pending.json                |
| - Identify highest priority unblocked task                        |
| - Determine exact steps to complete it                            |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ACT: Execute the task                                             |
| - Dispatch subagent via Task tool OR execute directly             |
| - Write code, run tests, fix issues                               |
| - Commit changes atomically (git checkpoint)                      |
| - Update queue files (.loki/queue/*.json)                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| REFLECT: Did it work? What next?                                  |
| - Verify task success (tests pass, no errors)                     |
| - UPDATE .loki/CONTINUITY.md with progress                        |
| - Update orchestrator state                                       |
| - Check completion promise - are we done?                         |
| - If not done, loop back to REASON                                |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| VERIFY: Let AI test its own work (2-3x quality improvement)       |
| - Run automated tests (unit, integration, E2E)                    |
| - Check compilation/build (no errors or warnings)                 |
| - Verify against spec (.loki/specs/openapi.yaml)                  |
| - Run linters/formatters via post-write hooks                     |
| - Browser/runtime testing if applicable                           |
|                                                                   |
| IF VERIFICATION FAILS:                                            |
|   1. Capture error details (stack trace, logs)                    |
|   2. Analyze root cause                                           |
|   3. UPDATE CONTINUITY.md "Mistakes & Learnings"                  |
|   4. Rollback to last good git checkpoint (if needed)             |
|   5. Apply learning and RETRY from REASON                         |
|                                                                   |
| - If verification passes, mark task complete and continue         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**Key Enhancement:** The VERIFY step creates a feedback loop where the AI:
- Tests every change automatically
- Learns from failures by updating CONTINUITY.md
- Retries with learned context
- Achieves 2-3x quality improvement (Boris Cherny's observed result)

---

## CONTINUITY.md - Working Memory Protocol

**CRITICAL:** You have a persistent working memory file at `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` that maintains state across all turns of execution.

### AT THE START OF EVERY TURN:
1. Read `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` to orient yourself to the current state
2. Reference it throughout your reasoning
3. Never make decisions without checking CONTINUITY.md first

### AT THE END OF EVERY TURN:
1. Update `.loki/CONTINUITY.md` with any important new information
2. Record what was accomplished
3. Note what needs to happen next
4. Document any blockers or decisions made

### CONTINUITY.md Template

```markdown
# Loki Mode Working Memory
Last Updated: [ISO timestamp]
Current Phase: [bootstrap|discovery|architecture|development|qa|deployment|growth]
Current Iteration: [number]

## Active Goal
[What we're currently trying to accomplish - 1-2 sentences]

## Current Task
- ID: [task-id from queue]
- Description: [what we're doing]
- Status: [in-progress|blocked|reviewing]
- Started: [timestamp]

## Just Completed
- [Most recent accomplishment with file:line references]
- [Previous accomplishment]
- [etc - last 5 items]

## Next Actions (Priority Order)
1. [Immediate next step]
2. [Following step]
3. [etc]

## Active Blockers
- [Any current blockers or waiting items]

## Key Decisions This Session
- [Decision]: [Rationale] - [timestamp]

## Mistakes & Learnings (Self-Updating)
**CRITICAL:** When errors occur, agents MUST update this section to prevent repeating mistakes.

### Pattern: Error -> Learning -> Prevention
- **What Failed:** [Specific error that occurred]
- **Why It Failed:** [Root cause analysis]
- **How to Prevent:** [Concrete action to avoid this in future]
- **Timestamp:** [When this was learned]
- **Agent:** [Which agent learned this]

### Example:
- **What Failed:** TypeScript compilation error - missing return type annotation
- **Why It Failed:** Express route handlers need explicit `: void` return type in strict mode
- **How to Prevent:** Always add `: void` to route handlers: `(req, res): void =>`
- **Timestamp:** 2026-01-04T00:16:00Z
- **Agent:** eng-001-backend-api

**Self-Update Protocol:**
```
ON_ERROR:
  1. Capture error details (stack trace, context)
  2. Analyze root cause
  3. Write learning to CONTINUITY.md "Mistakes & Learnings"
  4. Update approach based on learning
  5. Retry with corrected approach
```

## Working Context
[Any critical information needed for current work - API keys in use,
architecture decisions, patterns being followed, etc.]

## Files Currently Being Modified
- [file path]: [what we're changing]
```

---

## Memory Hierarchy

The memory systems work together:

1. **CONTINUITY.md** = Working memory (current session state, updated every turn)
2. **ledgers/** = Agent-specific state (checkpointed periodically)
3. **handoffs/** = Agent-to-agent transfers (on agent switch)
4. **learnings/** = Extracted patterns (on task completion)
5. **rules/** = Permanent validated patterns (promoted from learnings)

**CONTINUITY.md is the PRIMARY source of truth for "what am I doing right now?"**

---

## Git Checkpoint System

**CRITICAL:** Every completed task MUST create a git checkpoint for rollback safety.

### Protocol: Automatic Commits After Task Completion

**RULE:** When `task.status == "completed"`, create a git commit immediately.

```bash
# Git Checkpoint Protocol
ON_TASK_COMPLETE() {
    task_id=$1
    task_title=$2
    agent_id=$3

    # Stage modified files
    git add <modified_files>

    # Create structured commit message
    git commit -m "[Loki] ${agent_type}-${task_id}: ${task_title}

${detailed_description}

Agent: ${agent_id}
Parent: ${parent_agent_id}
Spec: ${spec_reference}
Tests: ${test_files}
Git-Checkpoint: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)"

    # Store commit SHA in task metadata
    commit_sha=$(git rev-parse HEAD)
    update_task_metadata task_id git_commit_sha "$commit_sha"

    # Update CONTINUITY.md
    echo "- Task $task_id completed (commit: $commit_sha)" >> .loki/CONTINUITY.md
}
```

### Commit Message Format

**Template:**
```
[Loki] ${agent_type}-${task_id}: ${task_title}

${detailed_description}

Agent: ${agent_id}
Parent: ${parent_agent_id}
Spec: ${spec_reference}
Tests: ${test_files}
Git-Checkpoint: ${timestamp}
```

**Example:**
```
[Loki] eng-005-backend: Implement POST /api/todos endpoint

Created todo creation endpoint per OpenAPI spec.
- Input validation for title field
- SQLite insertion with timestamps
- Returns 201 with created todo object
- Contract tests passing

Agent: eng-001-backend-api
Parent: orchestrator-main
Spec: .loki/specs/openapi.yaml#/paths/~1api~1todos/post
Tests: backend/tests/todos.contract.test.ts
Git-Checkpoint: 2026-01-04T05:45:00Z
```

### Rollback Strategy

**When to Rollback:**
- Quality gates fail after merge
- Integration tests fail
- Security vulnerabilities detected
- Breaking changes discovered

**Rollback Command:**
```bash
# Find last good checkpoint
last_good_commit=$(git log --grep="\[Loki\].*task-${last_good_task_id}" --format=%H -n 1)

# Rollback to that checkpoint
git reset --hard $last_good_commit

# Update CONTINUITY.md
echo "ROLLBACK: Reset to task-${last_good_task_id} (commit: $last_good_commit)" >> .loki/CONTINUITY.md

# Re-queue failed tasks
move_tasks_to_pending after_task=$last_good_task_id
```

## If Subagent Fails

1. Do NOT try to fix manually (context pollution)
2. Dispatch fix subagent with specific error context
3. If fix subagent fails 3x, move to dead letter queue
4. Open circuit breaker for that agent type
5. Alert orchestrator for human review




### Tool Orchestration

# Tool Orchestration Patterns Reference

Research-backed patterns inspired by NVIDIA ToolOrchestra, OpenAI Agents SDK, and multi-agent coordination research.

---

## Overview

Effective tool orchestration requires four key innovations:
1. **Tracing Spans** - Hierarchical event tracking (OpenAI SDK pattern)
2. **Efficiency Metrics** - Track computational cost per task
3. **Reward Signals** - Outcome, efficiency, and preference rewards for learning
4. **Dynamic Selection** - Adapt agent count and types based on task complexity

---

## Tracing Spans Architecture (OpenAI SDK Pattern)

### Span Types

Every operation is wrapped in a typed span for observability:

```yaml
span_types:
  agent_span:     # Wraps entire agent execution
  generation_span: # Wraps LLM API calls
  function_span:  # Wraps tool/function calls
  guardrail_span: # Wraps validation checks
  handoff_span:   # Wraps agent-to-agent transfers
  custom_span:    # User-defined operations
```

### Hierarchical Trace Structure

```json
{
  "trace_id": "trace_abc123def456",
  "workflow_name": "implement_feature",
  "group_id": "session_xyz789",
  "spans": [

## Efficiency Metrics System

### Why Track Efficiency?

ToolOrchestra achieves 70% cost reduction vs GPT-5 by explicitly optimizing for efficiency. Loki Mode should track:

- **Token usage** per task (input + output)
- **Wall clock time** per task
- **Agent spawns** per task
- **Retry count** before success

### Efficiency Tracking Schema

```json
{
  "task_id": "task-2026-01-06-001",
  "correlation_id": "session-abc123",
  "started_at": "2026-01-06T10:00:00Z",
  "completed_at": "2026-01-06T10:05:32Z",
  "metrics": {
    "wall_time_seconds": 332,
    "agents_spawned": 3,
    "total_agent_calls": 7,
    "retry_count": 1,
    "retry_reasons": ["test_failure"],
    "recovery_rate": 1.0,
    "model_usage": {
      "haiku": {"calls": 4, "est_tokens": 12000},
      "sonnet": {"calls": 2, "est_tokens": 8000},
      "opus": {"calls": 1, "est_tokens": 6000}
    }
  },
  "outcome": "success",
  "outcome_reason": "tests_passed_after_fix",
  "efficiency_score": 0.85,
  "efficiency_factors": ["used_haiku_for_tests", "parallel_review"],
  "quality_pillars": {
    "tool_selection_correct": true,
    "tool_reliability_rate": 0.95,
    "memory_retrieval_relevant": true,
    "goal_adherence": 1.0
  }
}
```

**Why capture these metrics?** (Based on multi-agent research)

1. **Capture intent, not just actions** ([Hashrocket](https://hashrocket.substack.com/p/the-hidden-cost-of-well-fix-it-later))
   - "UX debt turns into data debt" - recording actions without intent creates useless analytics

2. **Track recovery rate** ([Assessment Framework, arXiv 2512.12791](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12791v1))
   - `recovery_rate = successful_retries / total_retries`
   - Paper found "perfect tool sequencing but only 33% policy adherence" - surface metrics mask failures

3. **Distributed tracing** ([Maxim AI](https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/best-practices-for-building-production-ready-multi-agent-systems/))
   - `correlation_id`: Links all tasks in a session for end-to-end tracing
   - Essential for debugging multi-agent coordination failures

4. **Tool reliability separate from selection** ([Stanford/Harvard](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/12/24/this-ai-paper-from-stanford-and-harvard-explains-why-most-agentic-ai-systems-feel-impressive-in-demos-and-then-completely-fall-apart-in-real-use/))
   - `tool_selection_correct`: Did we pick the right tool?
   - `tool_reliability_rate`: Did the tool work as expected? (tools can fail even when correctly selected)
   - Key insight: "Tool use reliability" is a primary demo-to-deployment gap

5. **Quality pillars beyond outcomes** ([Assessment Framework](https://arxiv.org/html/2512.12791v1))
   - `memory_retrieval_relevant`: Did episodic/semantic retrieval help?
   - `goal_adherence`: Did we stay on task? (0.0-1.0 score)

### Efficiency Score Calculation

```python
def calculate_efficiency_score(metrics, task_complexity):
    """
    Score from 0-1 where higher is more efficient.
    Based on ToolOrchestra's efficiency reward signal.
    """
    # Baseline expectations by complexity
    baselines = {
        "trivial": {"time": 60, "agents": 1, "retries": 0},
        "simple": {"time": 180, "agents": 2, "retries": 0},
        "moderate": {"time": 600, "agents": 4, "retries": 1},
        "complex": {"time": 1800, "agents": 8, "retries": 2},
        "critical": {"time": 3600, "agents": 12, "retries": 3}
    }

    baseline = baselines[task_complexity]

    # Calculate component scores (1.0 = at baseline, >1 = better, <1 = worse)
    time_score = min(1.0, baseline["time"] / max(metrics["wall_time_seconds"], 1))
    agent_score = min(1.0, baseline["agents"] / max(metrics["agents_spawned"], 1))
    retry_score = 1.0 - (metrics["retry_count"] / (baseline["retries"] + 3))

    # Weighted average (time matters most)
    return (time_score * 0.5) + (agent_score * 0.3) + (retry_score * 0.2)
```

### Standard Reason Codes

Use consistent codes to enable pattern analysis:

```yaml
outcome_reasons:
  success:
    - tests_passed_first_try
    - tests_passed_after_fix
    - review_approved
    - spec_validated
  partial:
    - tests_partial_pass
    - review_concerns_minor
    - timeout_partial_work
  failure:
    - tests_failed
    - review_blocked
    - dependency_missing
    - timeout_no_progress
    - error_unrecoverable

retry_reasons:
  - test_failure
  - lint_error
  - type_error
  - review_rejection
  - rate_limit
  - timeout
  - dependency_conflict

efficiency_factors:
  positive:
    - used_haiku_for_simple
    - parallel_execution
    - cached_result
    - first_try_success
    - spec_driven
  negative:
    - used_opus_for_simple
    - sequential_when_parallel_possible
    - multiple_retries
    - missing_context
    - unclear_requirements
```

## Reward Signal Framework

### Three Reward Types (ToolOrchestra Pattern)

```
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 1. OUTCOME REWARD                                                 |
|    - Did the task succeed? Binary + quality grade                 |
|    - Signal: +1.0 (success), 0.0 (partial), -1.0 (failure)       |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 2. EFFICIENCY REWARD                                              |
|    - Did we use resources wisely?                                 |
|    - Signal: 0.0 to 1.0 based on efficiency score                |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| 3. PREFERENCE REWARD                                              |
|    - Did the user like the approach/result?                       |
|    - Signal: Inferred from user actions (accept/reject/modify)   |
+------------------------------------------------------------------+
```

### Outcome Reward Implementation

```python
def calculate_outcome_reward(task_result):
    """
    Outcome reward based on task completion status.
    """
    if task_result.status == "completed":
        # Grade the quality of completion
        if task_result.tests_passed and task_result.review_passed:
            return 1.0  # Full success
        elif task_result.tests_passed:
            return 0.7  # Tests pass but review had concerns
        else:
            return 0.3  # Completed but with issues

    elif task_result.status == "partial":
        return 0.0  # Partial completion, no reward

    else:  # failed
        return -1.0  # Negative reward for failure
```

### Preference Reward Implementation

```python
def infer_preference_reward(task_result, user_actions):
    """
    Infer user preference from their actions after task completion.
    Based on implicit feedback patterns.
    """
    signals = []

    # Positive signals
    if "commit" in user_actions:
        signals.append(0.8)  # User committed our changes
    if "deploy" in user_actions:
        signals.append(1.0)  # User deployed our changes
    if "no_edits" in user_actions:
        signals.append(0.6)  # User didn't modify our output

    # Negative signals
    if "revert" in user_actions:
        signals.append(-1.0)  # User reverted our changes
    if "manual_fix" in user_actions:
        signals.append(-0.5)  # User had to fix our work
    if "retry_different" in user_actions:
        signals.append(-0.3)  # User asked for different approach

    # Neutral (no signal)
    if not signals:
        return None

    return sum(signals) / len(signals)
```

### Reward Aggregation for Learning

```python
def aggregate_rewards(outcome, efficiency, preference):
    """
    Combine rewards into single learning signal.
    Weights based on ToolOrchestra findings.
    """
    # Outcome is most important (must succeed)
    # Efficiency secondary (once successful, optimize)
    # Preference tertiary (align with user style)

    weights = {
        "outcome": 0.6,
        "efficiency": 0.25,
        "preference": 0.15
    }

    total = outcome * weights["outcome"]
    total += efficiency * weights["efficiency"]

    if preference is not None:
        total += preference * weights["preference"]
    else:
        # Redistribute weight if no preference signal
        total = total / (1 - weights["preference"])

    return total
```

---

## Dynamic Agent Selection

### Task Complexity Classification

```python
def classify_task_complexity(task):
    """
    Classify task to determine agent allocation.
    Based on ToolOrchestra's tool selection flexibility.
    """
    complexity_signals = {
        # File scope signals

    }

    score = 0
    for signal, weight in complexity_signals.items():
        if task.has_signal(signal):
            score += weight

    # Map score to complexity level
    if score <= -2:
        return "trivial"
    elif score <= 0:
        return "simple"
    elif score <= 2:
        return "moderate"
    elif score <= 4:
        return "complex"
    else:
        return "critical"
```

### Agent Allocation by Complexity

```yaml
# Agent allocation strategy

    review: exhaustive     # Multiple review rounds
    parallel: true
    human_checkpoint: true # Pause for human review
```

### Dynamic Selection Algorithm

```python
def select_agents_for_task(task, available_agents):
    """

    Inspired by ToolOrchestra's configurable tool selection.
    """

## Multi-Dimensional Evaluation

Based on [Measurement Imbalance research (arXiv 2506.02064)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02064):

> "Technical metrics dominate assessments (83%), while human-centered (30%), safety (53%), and economic (30%) remain peripheral"

**Loki Mode tracks four evaluation axes:**

| Axis | Metrics | Current Coverage |
|------|---------|------------------|
| **Technical** | success_rate, efficiency_score, recovery_rate | Full |
| **Human-Centered** | preference_reward, goal_adherence | Partial |
| **Safety** | policy_adherence, quality_gates_passed | Full (via review system) |
| **Economic** | model_usage, agents_spawned, wall_time | Full |
