## Patterns

### Link Token Creation and Exchange

Create a link_token for Plaid Link, exchange public_token for access_token.
Link tokens are short-lived, one-time use. Access tokens don't expire but
may need updating when users change passwords.


### Transactions Sync

Use /transactions/sync for incremental transaction updates. More efficient
than /transactions/get. Handle webhooks for real-time updates instead of
polling.


### Item Error Handling and Update Mode

Handle ITEM_LOGIN_REQUIRED errors by putting users through Link update mode.
Listen for PENDING_DISCONNECT webhook to proactively prompt users.


## Anti-Patterns

### ❌ Storing Access Tokens in Plain Text

### ❌ Polling Instead of Webhooks

### ❌ Ignoring Item Errors
