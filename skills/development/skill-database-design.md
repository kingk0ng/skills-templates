> **How to Use This Template**
>
> This template can be used with various AI coding assistants:
> 
> **GitHub Copilot:**
> - Add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md` in your repository
> - Reference in chat: `@workspace` to include in context
> - Add specific sections to your workspace instructions
> 
> **Augment Code:**
> - Load context: `aug context add <path-to-this-file>`
> - Reference in queries naturally
> - Use with specific commands
> 
> **Claude (Desktop/Web):**
> - Add to Project Knowledge in Claude Projects
> - Reference in custom instructions
> - Copy relevant sections as needed
> 
> **ChatGPT:**
> - Add to Custom GPT configuration
> - Include in conversation instructions
> - Use as system prompt
> 
> **Generic Usage:**
> Copy the content below and paste it into your AI assistant's context window
> or system instructions.

# Database Design

> **Learn to THINK, not copy SQL patterns.**

## 🎯 Selective Reading Rule

**Read ONLY files relevant to the request!** Check the content map, find what you need.

| File | Description | When to Read |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `database-selection.md` | PostgreSQL vs Neon vs Turso vs SQLite | Choosing database |
| `orm-selection.md` | Drizzle vs Prisma vs Kysely | Choosing ORM |
| `schema-design.md` | Normalization, PKs, relationships | Designing schema |
| `indexing.md` | Index types, composite indexes | Performance tuning |
| `optimization.md` | N+1, EXPLAIN ANALYZE | Query optimization |
| `migrations.md` | Safe migrations, serverless DBs | Schema changes |

---

## ⚠️ Core Principle

- ASK user for database preferences when unclear
- Choose database/ORM based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to PostgreSQL for everything

---

## Decision Checklist

Before designing schema:

- [ ] Asked user about database preference?
- [ ] Chosen database for THIS context?
- [ ] Considered deployment environment?
- [ ] Planned index strategy?
- [ ] Defined relationship types?

---

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Default to PostgreSQL for simple apps (SQLite may suffice)
❌ Skip indexing
❌ Use SELECT * in production
❌ Store JSON when structured data is better
❌ Ignore N+1 queries


---

## 🚀 Usage

**Reference this template:** `@skill-database-design.md`


**Platform-specific:**
- **GitHub Copilot**: Add to `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- **Augment Code**: Use `aug context add` command
- **Cursor/Windsurf**: Reference in chat with `@filename`
- **Claude**: Add to Project Knowledge
- **ChatGPT**: Add to Custom GPT configuration
