# Neon Postgres

## Patterns

### Prisma with Neon Connection

Configure Prisma for Neon with connection pooling.

Use two connection strings:
- DATABASE_URL: Pooled connection for Prisma Client
- DIRECT_URL: Direct connection for Prisma Migrate

The pooled connection uses PgBouncer for up to 10K connections.
Direct connection required for migrations (DDL operations).


### Drizzle with Neon Serverless Driver

Use Drizzle ORM with Neon's serverless HTTP driver for
edge/serverless environments.

Two driver options:
- neon-http: Single queries over HTTP (fastest for one-off queries)
- neon-serverless: WebSocket for transactions and sessions


### Connection Pooling with PgBouncer

Neon provides built-in connection pooling via PgBouncer.

Key limits:
- Up to 10,000 concurrent connections to pooler
- Connections still consume underlying Postgres connections
- 7 connections reserved for Neon superuser

Use pooled endpoint for application, direct for migrations.
