# playwright

> Use when the task requires automating a real browser from the terminal (navigation, form filling, snapshots, screenshots, data extraction, UI-flow debugging) via `playwright-cli` or the bundled wrapper script.

# Playwright CLI Skill

Drive a real browser from the terminal using `playwright-cli`. Prefer the bundled wrapper script so the CLI works even when it is not globally installed.
Treat this skill as CLI-first automation. Do not pivot to `@playwright/test` unless the user explicitly asks for test files.

## Prerequisite check (required)

Before proposing commands, check whether `npx` is available (the wrapper depends on it):

```bash
command -v npx >/dev/null 2>&1
```

If it is not available, pause and ask the user to install Node.js/npm (which provides `npx`). Provide these steps verbatim:

```bash
# Verify Node/npm are installed
node --version
npm --version

# If missing, install Node.js/npm, then:
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

Once `npx` is present, proceed with the wrapper script. A global install of `playwright-cli` is optional.

## Skill path (set once)

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export PWCLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

## Quick start

Use the wrapper script:

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://playwright.dev --headed
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e15
"$PWCLI" type "Playwright"
"$PWCLI" press Enter
"$PWCLI" screenshot
```

If the user prefers a global install, this is also valid:

```bash
npm install -g @playwright/cli@latest
playwright-cli --help
```

## Core workflow

1. Open the page.
2. Snapshot to get stable element refs.
3. Interact using refs from the latest snapshot.
4. Re-snapshot after navigation or significant DOM changes.
5. Capture artifacts (screenshot, pdf, traces) when useful.

Minimal loop:

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## When to snapshot again

Snapshot again after:

- navigation
- clicking elements that change the UI substantially
- opening/closing modals or menus
- tab switches

Refs can go stale. When a command fails due to a missing ref, snapshot again.

## Recommended patterns

### Form fill and submit

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com/form
"$PWCLI" snapshot
"$PWCLI" fill e1 "user@example.com"
"$PWCLI" fill e2 "password123"
"$PWCLI" click e3
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

### Debug a UI flow with traces

```bash
"$PWCLI" open https://example.com --headed
"$PWCLI" tracing-start
# ...interactions...
"$PWCLI" tracing-stop
```

### Multi-tab work

```bash
"$PWCLI" tab-new https://example.com
"$PWCLI" tab-list
"$PWCLI" tab-select 0
"$PWCLI" snapshot
```

## Wrapper script

The wrapper script uses `npx --package @playwright/cli playwright-cli` so the CLI can run without a global install:

```bash
"$PWCLI" --help
```

Prefer the wrapper unless the repository already standardizes on a global install.

## References

Open only what you need:

- CLI command reference: `references/cli.md`
- Practical workflows and troubleshooting: `references/workflows.md`

## Guardrails

- Always snapshot before referencing element ids like `e12`.
- Re-snapshot when refs seem stale.
- Prefer explicit commands over `eval` and `run-code` unless needed.
- When you do not have a fresh snapshot, use placeholder refs like `eX` and say why; do not bypass refs with `run-code`.
- Use `--headed` when a visual check will help.
- When capturing artifacts in this repo, use `output/playwright/` and avoid introducing new top-level artifact folders.
- Default to CLI commands and workflows, not Playwright test specs.

### Workflows

# Playwright CLI Workflows

Use the wrapper script and snapshot often.
Assume `PWCLI` is set and `pwcli` is an alias for `"$PWCLI"`.
In this repo, run commands from `output/playwright/<label>/` to keep artifacts contained.

## Standard interaction loop

```bash
pwcli open https://example.com
pwcli snapshot
pwcli click e3
pwcli snapshot
```

## Form submission

```bash
pwcli open https://example.com/form --headed
pwcli snapshot
pwcli fill e1 "user@example.com"
pwcli fill e2 "password123"
pwcli click e3
pwcli snapshot
pwcli screenshot
```

## Data extraction

```bash
pwcli open https://example.com
pwcli snapshot
pwcli eval "document.title"
pwcli eval "el => el.textContent" e12
```

## Debugging and inspection

Capture console messages and network activity after reproducing an issue:

```bash
pwcli console warning
pwcli network
```

Record a trace around a suspicious flow:

```bash
pwcli tracing-start
# reproduce the issue
pwcli tracing-stop
pwcli screenshot
```

## Sessions

Use sessions to isolate work across projects:

```bash
pwcli --session marketing open https://example.com
pwcli --session marketing snapshot
pwcli --session checkout open https://example.com/checkout
```

Or set the session once:

```bash
export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=checkout
pwcli open https://example.com/checkout
```

## Configuration file

By default, the CLI reads `playwright-cli.json` from the current directory. Use `--config` to point at a specific file.

Minimal example:

```json
{
  "browser": {
    "launchOptions": {
      "headless": false
    },
    "contextOptions": {
      "viewport": { "width": 1280, "height": 720 }
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

- If an element ref fails, run `pwcli snapshot` again and retry.
- If the page looks wrong, re-open with `--headed` and resize the window.
- If a flow depends on prior state, use a named `--session`.




### Cli

# Playwright CLI Reference

Use the wrapper script unless the CLI is already installed globally:

```bash
export CODEX_HOME="${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}"
export PWCLI="$CODEX_HOME/skills/playwright/scripts/playwright_cli.sh"
"$PWCLI" --help
```

User-scoped skills install under `$CODEX_HOME/skills` (default: `~/.codex/skills`).

Optional convenience alias:

```bash
alias pwcli="$PWCLI"
```

## Core

```bash
pwcli open https://example.com
pwcli close
pwcli snapshot
pwcli click e3
pwcli dblclick e7
pwcli type "search terms"
pwcli press Enter
pwcli fill e5 "user@example.com"
pwcli drag e2 e8
pwcli hover e4
pwcli select e9 "option-value"
pwcli upload ./document.pdf
pwcli check e12
pwcli uncheck e12
pwcli eval "document.title"
pwcli eval "el => el.textContent" e5
pwcli dialog-accept
pwcli dialog-accept "confirmation text"
pwcli dialog-dismiss
pwcli resize 1920 1080
```

## Navigation

```bash
pwcli go-back
pwcli go-forward
pwcli reload
```

## Keyboard

```bash
pwcli press Enter
pwcli press ArrowDown
pwcli keydown Shift
pwcli keyup Shift
```

## Mouse

```bash
pwcli mousemove 150 300
pwcli mousedown
pwcli mousedown right
pwcli mouseup
pwcli mouseup right
pwcli mousewheel 0 100
```

## Save as

```bash
pwcli screenshot
pwcli screenshot e5
pwcli pdf
```

## Tabs

```bash
pwcli tab-list
pwcli tab-new
pwcli tab-new https://example.com/page
pwcli tab-close
pwcli tab-close 2
pwcli tab-select 0
```

## DevTools

```bash
pwcli console
pwcli console warning
pwcli network
pwcli run-code "await page.waitForTimeout(1000)"
pwcli tracing-start
pwcli tracing-stop
```

## Sessions

Use a named session to isolate work:

```bash
pwcli --session todo open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
pwcli --session todo snapshot
```

Or set an environment variable once:

```bash
export PLAYWRIGHT_CLI_SESSION=todo
pwcli open https://demo.playwright.dev/todomvc
```
