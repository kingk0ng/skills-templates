# scvi-tools

> This skill should be used when working with single-cell omics data analysis using scvi-tools, including scRNA-seq, scATAC-seq, CITE-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and other single-cell modalities. Use this skill for probabilistic modeling, batch correction, dimensionality reduction, differential expression, cell type annotation, multimodal integration, and spatial analysis tasks.

# scvi-tools

## Overview

scvi-tools is a comprehensive Python framework for probabilistic models in single-cell genomics. Built on PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning, it provides deep generative models using variational inference for analyzing diverse single-cell data modalities.

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Analyzing single-cell RNA-seq data (dimensionality reduction, batch correction, integration)
- Working with single-cell ATAC-seq or chromatin accessibility data
- Integrating multimodal data (CITE-seq, multiome, paired/unpaired datasets)
- Analyzing spatial transcriptomics data (deconvolution, spatial mapping)
- Performing differential expression analysis on single-cell data
- Conducting cell type annotation or transfer learning tasks
- Working with specialized single-cell modalities (methylation, cytometry, RNA velocity)
- Building custom probabilistic models for single-cell analysis

## Core Capabilities

scvi-tools provides models organized by data modality:

### 1. Single-Cell RNA-seq Analysis
Core models for expression analysis, batch correction, and integration. See `references/models-scrna-seq.md` for:
- **scVI**: Unsupervised dimensionality reduction and batch correction
- **scANVI**: Semi-supervised cell type annotation and integration
- **AUTOZI**: Zero-inflation detection and modeling
- **VeloVI**: RNA velocity analysis
- **contrastiveVI**: Perturbation effect isolation

### 2. Chromatin Accessibility (ATAC-seq)

- **PeakVI**: Peak-based ATAC-seq analysis and integration
- **PoissonVI**: Quantitative fragment count modeling
- **scBasset**: Deep learning approach with motif analysis

### 3. Multimodal & Multi-omics Integration

- **CytoVI**: Flow/mass cytometry batch correction
- **Solo**: Doublet detection
- **CellAssign**: Marker-based cell type annotation

## Typical Workflow

All scvi-tools models follow a consistent API pattern:

```python
# 1. Load and preprocess data (AnnData format)
import scvi
import scanpy as sc

adata = scvi.data.heart_cell_atlas_subsampled()
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_counts=3)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=1200)

# 2. Register data with model (specify layers, covariates)
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    layer="counts",  # Use raw counts, not log-normalized
    batch_key="batch",
    categorical_covariate_keys=["donor"],
    continuous_covariate_keys=["percent_mito"]
)

# 3. Create and train model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()

# 4. Extract latent representations and normalized values
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
normalized = model.get_normalized_expression(library_size=1e4)

# 5. Store in AnnData for downstream analysis
adata.obsm["X_scVI"] = latent
adata.layers["scvi_normalized"] = normalized

# 6. Downstream analysis with scanpy
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_scVI")
sc.tl.umap(adata)
sc.tl.leiden(adata)
```

**Key Design Principles:**
- **Raw counts required**: Models expect unnormalized count data for optimal performance
- **Unified API**: Consistent interface across all models (setup → train → extract)
- **AnnData-centric**: Seamless integration with the scanpy ecosystem
- **GPU acceleration**: Automatic utilization of available GPUs
- **Batch correction**: Handle technical variation through covariate registration

## Common Analysis Tasks

### Differential Expression
Probabilistic DE analysis using the learned generative models:

```python
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="TypeA",
    group2="TypeB",
    mode="change",  # Use composite hypothesis testing
    delta=0.25      # Minimum effect size threshold
)
```

See `references/differential-expression.md` for detailed methodology and interpretation.

### Model Persistence
Save and load trained models:

```python
# Save model
model.save("./model_directory", overwrite=True)

# Load model
model = scvi.model.SCVI.load("./model_directory", adata=adata)
```

### Batch Correction and Integration
Integrate datasets across batches or studies:

```python
# Register batch information
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, batch_key="study")

# Model automatically learns batch-corrected representations
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()
latent = model.get_latent_representation()  # Batch-corrected
```

## Theoretical Foundations

scvi-tools is built on:
- **Variational inference**: Approximate posterior distributions for scalable Bayesian inference
- **Deep generative models**: VAE architectures that learn complex data distributions
- **Amortized inference**: Shared neural networks for efficient learning across cells
- **Probabilistic modeling**: Principled uncertainty quantification and statistical testing

See `references/theoretical-foundations.md` for detailed background on the mathematical framework.

## Model-Specific Best Practices

### MethylVI/MethylANVI
1. **Sparsity**: Methylation data is inherently sparse; model accounts for this
2. **CpG selection**: Filter CpGs with very low coverage
3. **Biological interpretation**: Consider genomic context (promoters, enhancers)
4. **Integration**: For multi-omics, analyze separately then integrate results

### CytoVI
1. **Protein QC**: Remove low-quality or uninformative proteins
2. **Compensation**: Ensure proper spectral compensation before analysis
3. **Batch design**: Include biological and technical replicates
4. **Controls**: Use control samples to validate batch correction

### SysVI
1. **Sample size**: Designed for large-scale integration
2. **Batch definition**: Carefully define batch structure
3. **Biological validation**: Verify biological signals preserved

### Decipher
1. **Start point**: Define trajectory start cells if known
2. **Branching**: Specify expected number of branches
3. **Validation**: Use known markers to validate pseudotime
4. **Integration**: Works well with scVI embeddings

## Integration with Other Models

Many specialized models work well in combination:

**Methylation + Expression**:
```python
# Analyze separately, then integrate
methylvi_model = scvi.model.METHYLVI(meth_adata)
scvi_model = scvi.model.SCVI(rna_adata)

# Integrate results at analysis level
# E.g., correlate methylation and expression patterns
```

**Cytometry + CITE-seq**:
```python
# CytoVI for flow/CyTOF
cyto_model = scvi.model.CYTOVI(cyto_adata)

# totalVI for CITE-seq
cite_model = scvi.model.TOTALVI(cite_adata)

# Compare protein measurements across platforms
```

**ATAC + RNA (Multiome)**:
```python
# MultiVI for joint analysis
multivi_model = scvi.model.MULTIVI(multiome_adata)

# peRegLM for regulatory links
pereglm_model = scvi.model.PEREGLM(multiome_adata)
```

## Choosing Specialized Models

### Decision Tree

1. **What data modality?**
   - Methylation → MethylVI/MethylANVI
   - Flow/CyTOF → CytoVI
   - Trajectory → Decipher
   - Multi-batch integration → SysVI
   - Regulatory links → peRegLM

2. **Do you have labels?**
   - Yes → MethylANVI (methylation)
   - No → MethylVI (methylation)

3. **What's your main goal?**
   - Batch correction → CytoVI, SysVI
   - Trajectory/pseudotime → Decipher
   - Peak-gene links → peRegLM
   - Methylation patterns → MethylVI/ANVI

## Example: Complete Methylation Analysis

```python
import scvi
import scanpy as sc

# 1. Load methylation data
meth_adata = sc.read_h5ad("methylation_data.h5ad")

# 2. QC: filter low-coverage CpG sites
sc.pp.filter_genes(meth_adata, min_cells=10)

# 3. Setup MethylVI
scvi.model.METHYLVI.setup_anndata(
    meth_adata,
    layer="methylation",
    batch_key="batch"
)

# 4. Train model
model = scvi.model.METHYLVI(meth_adata, n_latent=15)
model.train(max_epochs=400)

# 5. Get latent representation
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
meth_adata.obsm["X_MethylVI"] = latent

# 6. Clustering
sc.pp.neighbors(meth_adata, use_rep="X_MethylVI")
sc.tl.umap(meth_adata)
sc.tl.leiden(meth_adata)

# 7. Differential methylation
dm_results = model.differential_methylation(
    groupby="leiden",
    group1="0",
    group2="1"
)

# 8. Save
model.save("methylvi_model")
meth_adata.write("methylation_analyzed.h5ad")
```

## External Tools Integration

Some specialized models are available as external packages:

**SOLO** (doublet detection):
```python
from scvi.external import SOLO

solo = SOLO.from_scvi_model(scvi_model)
solo.train()
doublets = solo.predict()
```

**scArches** (reference mapping):
```python
from scvi.external import SCARCHES

# For transfer learning and query-to-reference mapping
```

These external tools extend scvi-tools functionality for specific use cases.

### Workflows

# Common Workflows and Best Practices

This document covers common workflows, best practices, and advanced usage patterns for scvi-tools.

## Standard Analysis Workflow

### 1. Data Loading and Preparation

```python
import scvi
import scanpy as sc
import numpy as np

# Load data (AnnData format required)
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad")
# Or load from other formats
# adata = sc.read_10x_mtx("filtered_feature_bc_matrix/")
# adata = sc.read_csv("counts.csv")

# Basic QC metrics
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, inplace=True)
adata.var['mt'] = adata.var_names.str.startswith('MT-')
sc.pp.calculate_qc_metrics(adata, qc_vars=['mt'], inplace=True)
```

### 2. Quality Control

```python
# Filter cells
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, min_genes=200)
sc.pp.filter_cells(adata, max_genes=5000)

# Filter genes
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=3)

# Filter by mitochondrial content
adata = adata[adata.obs['pct_counts_mt'] < 20, :]

# Remove doublets (optional, before training)
sc.external.pp.scrublet(adata)
adata = adata[~adata.obs['predicted_doublet'], :]
```

### 3. Preprocessing for scvi-tools

```python
# IMPORTANT: scvi-tools needs RAW counts
# If you've already normalized, use the raw layer or reload data

# Save raw counts if not already available
if 'counts' not in adata.layers:
    adata.layers['counts'] = adata.X.copy()

# Feature selection (optional but recommended)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(
    adata,
    n_top_genes=4000,
    subset=False,  # Keep all genes, just mark HVGs
    batch_key="batch"  # If multiple batches
)

# Filter to HVGs (optional)
# adata = adata[:, adata.var['highly_variable']]
```

### 4. Register Data with scvi-tools

```python
# Setup AnnData for scvi-tools
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    layer="counts",  # Use raw counts
    batch_key="batch",  # Technical batches
    categorical_covariate_keys=["donor", "condition"],
    continuous_covariate_keys=["percent_mito", "n_counts"]
)

# Check registration
adata.uns['_scvi']['summary_stats']
```

### 5. Model Training

```python
# Create model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(
    adata,
    n_latent=30,  # Latent dimensions
    n_layers=2,   # Network depth
    n_hidden=128, # Hidden layer size
    dropout_rate=0.1,
    gene_likelihood="zinb"  # zero-inflated negative binomial
)

# Train model
model.train(
    max_epochs=400,
    batch_size=128,
    train_size=0.9,
    early_stopping=True,
    check_val_every_n_epoch=10
)

# View training history
train_history = model.history["elbo_train"]
val_history = model.history["elbo_validation"]
```

### 6. Extract Results

```python
# Get latent representation
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
adata.obsm["X_scVI"] = latent

# Get normalized expression
normalized = model.get_normalized_expression(
    adata,
    library_size=1e4,
    n_samples=25  # Monte Carlo samples
)
adata.layers["scvi_normalized"] = normalized
```

### 7. Downstream Analysis

```python
# Clustering on scVI latent space
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_scVI", n_neighbors=15)
sc.tl.umap(adata, min_dist=0.3)
sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=0.8, key_added="leiden")

# Visualization
sc.pl.umap(adata, color=["leiden", "batch", "cell_type"])

# Differential expression
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="leiden",
    group1="0",
    group2="1",
    mode="change",
    delta=0.25
)
```

### 8. Model Persistence

```python
# Save model
model_dir = "./scvi_model/"
model.save(model_dir, overwrite=True)

# Save AnnData with results
adata.write("analyzed_data.h5ad")

# Load model later
model = scvi.model.SCVI.load(model_dir, adata=adata)
```

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Key Hyperparameters

**Architecture**:
- `n_latent`: Latent space dimensionality (10-50)
  - Larger for complex, heterogeneous datasets
  - Smaller for simple datasets or to prevent overfitting
- `n_layers`: Number of hidden layers (1-3)
  - More layers for complex data, but diminishing returns
- `n_hidden`: Nodes per hidden layer (64-256)
  - Scale with dataset size and complexity

**Training**:
- `max_epochs`: Training iterations (200-500)
  - Use early stopping to prevent overfitting
- `batch_size`: Samples per batch (64-256)
  - Larger for big datasets, smaller for limited memory
- `lr`: Learning rate (0.001 default, usually good)

**Model-specific**:
- `gene_likelihood`: Distribution ("zinb", "nb", "poisson")
  - "zinb" for sparse data with zero-inflation
  - "nb" for less sparse data
- `dispersion`: Gene or gene-batch specific
  - "gene" for simple, "gene-batch" for complex batch effects

### Hyperparameter Search Example

```python
from scvi.model import SCVI

# Define search space
latent_dims = [10, 20, 30]
n_layers_options = [1, 2]

best_score = float('-inf')
best_params = None

for n_latent in latent_dims:
    for n_layers in n_layers_options:
        model = SCVI(
            adata,
            n_latent=n_latent,
            n_layers=n_layers
        )
        model.train(max_epochs=200)

        # Evaluate on validation set
        val_elbo = model.history["elbo_validation"][-1]

        if val_elbo > best_score:
            best_score = val_elbo
            best_params = {"n_latent": n_latent, "n_layers": n_layers}

print(f"Best params: {best_params}")
```

### Using Optuna for Hyperparameter Optimization

```python
import optuna

def objective(trial):
    n_latent = trial.suggest_int("n_latent", 10, 50)
    n_layers = trial.suggest_int("n_layers", 1, 3)
    n_hidden = trial.suggest_categorical("n_hidden", [64, 128, 256])

    model = scvi.model.SCVI(
        adata,
        n_latent=n_latent,
        n_layers=n_layers,
        n_hidden=n_hidden
    )

    model.train(max_epochs=200, early_stopping=True)
    return model.history["elbo_validation"][-1]

study = optuna.create_study(direction="maximize")
study.optimize(objective, n_trials=20)

print(f"Best parameters: {study.best_params}")
```

## GPU Acceleration

### Enable GPU Training

```python
# Automatic GPU detection
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train(accelerator="auto")  # Uses GPU if available

# Force GPU
model.train(accelerator="gpu")

# Multi-GPU
model.train(accelerator="gpu", devices=2)

# Check if GPU is being used
import torch
print(f"CUDA available: {torch.cuda.is_available()}")
print(f"GPU count: {torch.cuda.device_count()}")
```

### GPU Memory Management

```python
# Reduce batch size if OOM
model.train(batch_size=64)  # Instead of default 128

# Mixed precision training (saves memory)
model.train(precision=16)

# Clear cache between runs
import torch
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

## Batch Integration Strategies

### Strategy 1: Simple Batch Key

```python
# For standard batch correction
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, batch_key="batch")
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
```

### Strategy 2: Multiple Covariates

```python
# Correct for multiple technical factors
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    batch_key="sequencing_batch",
    categorical_covariate_keys=["donor", "tissue"],
    continuous_covariate_keys=["percent_mito"]
)
```

### Strategy 3: Hierarchical Batches

```python
# When batches have hierarchical structure
# E.g., samples within studies
adata.obs["batch_hierarchy"] = (
    adata.obs["study"].astype(str) + "_" +
    adata.obs["sample"].astype(str)
)

scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, batch_key="batch_hierarchy")
```

## Reference Mapping (scArches)

### Training Reference Model

```python
# Train on reference dataset
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(ref_adata, batch_key="batch")
ref_model = scvi.model.SCVI(ref_adata)
ref_model.train()

# Save reference
ref_model.save("reference_model")
```

### Mapping Query to Reference

```python
# Load reference
ref_model = scvi.model.SCVI.load("reference_model", adata=ref_adata)

# Setup query with same parameters
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(query_adata, batch_key="batch")

# Transfer learning
query_model = scvi.model.SCVI.load_query_data(
    query_adata,
    "reference_model"
)

# Fine-tune on query (optional)
query_model.train(max_epochs=200)

# Get query embeddings
query_latent = query_model.get_latent_representation()

# Transfer labels using KNN
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=15)
knn.fit(ref_model.get_latent_representation(), ref_adata.obs["cell_type"])
query_adata.obs["predicted_cell_type"] = knn.predict(query_latent)
```

## Model Minification

Reduce model size for faster inference:

```python
# Train full model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()

# Minify for deployment
minified = model.minify_adata(adata)

# Save minified version
minified.write("minified_data.h5ad")
model.save("minified_model")

# Load and use (much faster)
mini_model = scvi.model.SCVI.load("minified_model", adata=minified)
```

## Memory-Efficient Data Loading

### Using AnnDataLoader

```python
from scvi.data import AnnDataLoader

# For very large datasets
dataloader = AnnDataLoader(
    adata,
    batch_size=128,
    shuffle=True,
    drop_last=False
)

# Custom training loop (advanced)
for batch in dataloader:
    # Process batch
    pass
```

### Using Backed AnnData

```python
# For data too large for memory
adata = sc.read_h5ad("huge_dataset.h5ad", backed='r')

# scvi-tools works with backed mode
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata)
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()
```

## Model Interpretation

### Feature Importance with SHAP

```python
import shap

# Get SHAP values for interpretability
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model.module, background_data)
shap_values = explainer.shap_values(test_data)

# Visualize
shap.summary_plot(shap_values, feature_names=adata.var_names)
```

### Gene Correlation Analysis

```python
# Get gene-gene correlation matrix
correlation = model.get_feature_correlation_matrix(
    adata,
    transform_batch="batch1"
)

# Visualize top correlated genes
import seaborn as sns
sns.heatmap(correlation[:50, :50], cmap="coolwarm")
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: NaN Loss During Training

**Causes**:
- Learning rate too high
- Unnormalized input (must use raw counts)
- Data quality issues

**Solutions**:
```python
# Reduce learning rate
model.train(lr=0.0001)

# Check data
assert adata.X.min() >= 0  # No negative values
assert np.isnan(adata.X).sum() == 0  # No NaNs

# Use more stable likelihood
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, gene_likelihood="nb")
```

### Issue: Poor Batch Correction

**Solutions**:
```python
# Increase batch effect modeling
model = scvi.model.SCVI(
    adata,
    encode_covariates=True,  # Encode batch in encoder
    deeply_inject_covariates=False
)

# Or try opposite
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, deeply_inject_covariates=True)

# Use more latent dimensions
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, n_latent=50)
```

### Issue: Model Not Training (ELBO Not Decreasing)

**Solutions**:
```python
# Increase learning rate
model.train(lr=0.005)

# Increase network capacity
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, n_hidden=256, n_layers=2)

# Train longer
model.train(max_epochs=500)
```

### Issue: Out of Memory (OOM)

**Solutions**:
```python
# Reduce batch size
model.train(batch_size=64)

# Use mixed precision
model.train(precision=16)

# Reduce model size
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata, n_latent=10, n_hidden=64)

# Use backed AnnData
adata = sc.read_h5ad("data.h5ad", backed='r')
```

## Performance Benchmarking

```python
import time

# Time training
start = time.time()
model.train(max_epochs=400)
training_time = time.time() - start
print(f"Training time: {training_time:.2f}s")

# Time inference
start = time.time()
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
inference_time = time.time() - start
print(f"Inference time: {inference_time:.2f}s")

# Memory usage
import psutil
import os
process = psutil.Process(os.getpid())
memory_gb = process.memory_info().rss / 1024**3
print(f"Memory usage: {memory_gb:.2f} GB")
```

## Best Practices Summary

1. **Always use raw counts**: Never log-normalize before scvi-tools
2. **Feature selection**: Use highly variable genes for efficiency
3. **Batch correction**: Register all known technical covariates
4. **Early stopping**: Use validation set to prevent overfitting
5. **Model saving**: Always save trained models
6. **GPU usage**: Use GPU for large datasets (>10k cells)
7. **Hyperparameter tuning**: Start with defaults, tune if needed
8. **Validation**: Check batch correction visually (UMAP colored by batch)
9. **Documentation**: Keep track of preprocessing steps
10. **Reproducibility**: Set random seeds (`scvi.settings.seed = 0`)

adata = sc.read_h5ad("atac_data.h5ad")

# 2. Filter low-quality peaks
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=10)

# 3. Setup and train PeakVI
scvi.model.PEAKVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    batch_key="sample"
)

model = scvi.model.PEAKVI(adata, n_latent=20)
model.train(max_epochs=400)

# 4. Extract latent representation
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
adata.obsm["X_PeakVI"] = latent

sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_PeakVI")
sc.tl.umap(adata)
sc.tl.leiden(adata, key_added="clusters")

# 6. Differential accessibility
da_results = model.differential_accessibility(
    groupby="clusters",
    group1="0",
    group2="1"
)

# 7. Save model
model.save("peakvi_model")
```

## Integration with Gene Expression (RNA+ATAC)

For paired multimodal data (RNA+ATAC from same cells), use **MultiVI** instead:

```python
# For 10x Multiome or similar paired data
scvi.model.MULTIVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    batch_key="sample",
    modality_key="modality"  # "RNA" or "ATAC"
)

model = scvi.model.MULTIVI(adata)
model.train()

# Get joint latent space
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
```

See `models-multimodal.md` for more details on multimodal integration.

## Best Practices for ATAC-seq Analysis

1. **Quality Control**:
   - Filter cells with very low or very high peak counts
   - Remove peaks present in very few cells
   - Filter mitochondrial and sex chromosome peaks if needed

2. **Batch Correction**:
   - Always include `batch_key` if integrating multiple samples
   - Consider technical covariates (sequencing depth, TSS enrichment)

3. **Feature Selection**:
   - Unlike RNA-seq, all peaks are often used
   - Consider filtering very rare peaks for efficiency

4. **Latent Dimensions**:
   - Start with `n_latent=10-30` depending on dataset complexity
   - Larger values for more heterogeneous datasets

5. **Downstream Analysis**:
   - Use latent representations for clustering and visualization
   - Link peaks to genes for regulatory analysis
   - Perform motif enrichment on cluster-specific peaks

6. **Computational Considerations**:
   - ATAC-seq matrices are often very large (many peaks)
   - Consider downsampling peaks for initial exploration
   - Use GPU acceleration for large datasets

rna_normalized = model.get_normalized_expression()
protein_normalized = model.get_normalized_expression(
    transform_batch="batch1",
    protein_expression=True
)

# Differential expression (works for both RNA and protein)

    indices=rna_only_indices
)

# Get normalized expression/accessibility
rna_normalized = model.get_normalized_expression()
atac_normalized = model.get_accessibility_estimates()
```

```python
# Separate analysis per modality
rna_subset = adata[adata.obs["modality"].str.contains("RNA")]
atac_subset = adata[adata.obs["modality"].str.contains("ATAC")]
```

## MrVI (Multi-resolution Variational Inference)

**Purpose**: Multi-sample analysis accounting for sample-specific and shared variation.

    layer="counts",
    batch_key="batch",
    sample_key="sample"  # Critical: defines biological samples
)

model = scvi.model.MRVI(adata, n_latent=10, n_latent_sample=5)
model.train()

# Get representations
shared_latent = model.get_latent_representation()  # Shared across samples
sample_specific = model.get_sample_specific_representation()

sample_distances = model.get_sample_distances()
```

**Key Parameters**:
- `n_latent`: Dimensionality of shared latent space
- `n_latent_sample`: Dimensionality of sample-specific space
- `sample_key`: Column defining biological samples

**Analysis Workflow**:
```python
# 1. Identify shared cell types across samples
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_MrVI_shared")

    group2="Healthy"
)
```

**Use Cases**:
- **Multi-donor studies**: Separate donor effects from cell type variation
- **Disease studies**: Identify disease-specific vs. shared biology
- **Time series**: Separate temporal from stable variation

## totalVI vs. MultiVI vs. MrVI: When to Use Which?

### totalVI
**Use for**: CITE-seq (RNA + protein, same cells)
- Paired measurements
- Single modality type per feature
- Focus: protein imputation, joint analysis

### MultiVI
**Use for**: Multiple modalities (RNA + ATAC, etc.)

- Different feature types
- Focus: cross-modality integration and imputation

### MrVI
**Use for**: Multi-sample RNA-seq
- Single modality (RNA)
- Multiple biological samples
- Focus: sample-level variation decomposition

## Integration Best Practices

### For CITE-seq (totalVI)
1. **Quality control proteins**: Remove low-quality antibodies
2. **Background subtraction**: Use empirical background prior
3. **Joint clustering**: Use joint latent space, not RNA alone
4. **Validation**: Check known markers in both modalities

### For Multiome/Multi-modal (MultiVI)

2. **Balance modalities**: Ensure reasonable representation of each
3. **Modality weights**: Consider if one modality dominates
4. **Imputation validation**: Validate imputed values carefully

### For Multi-sample (MrVI)
1. **Sample definition**: Carefully define biological samples
2. **Sample size**: Need sufficient cells per sample
3. **Covariate handling**: Properly account for batch vs. sample
4. **Interpretation**: Distinguish technical from biological variation

## Complete Example: CITE-seq Analysis with totalVI

```python
import scvi
import scanpy as sc

# 1. Load CITE-seq data
adata = sc.read_h5ad("cite_seq.h5ad")

# 2. QC and filtering
sc.pp.filter_genes(adata, min_cells=3)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(adata, n_top_genes=4000)

# Protein QC
protein_counts = adata.obsm["protein_expression"]
# Remove low-quality proteins

# 3. Setup totalVI
scvi.model.TOTALVI.setup_anndata(
    adata,
    layer="counts",
    protein_expression_obsm_key="protein_expression",
    batch_key="batch"
)

# 4. Train
model = scvi.model.TOTALVI(adata, n_latent=20)
model.train(max_epochs=400)

# 5. Extract joint representation
latent = model.get_latent_representation()
adata.obsm["X_totalVI"] = latent

# 6. Clustering on joint space
sc.pp.neighbors(adata, use_rep="X_totalVI")
sc.tl.umap(adata)
sc.tl.leiden(adata, resolution=0.5)

# 7. Differential expression for both modalities
rna_de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="leiden",

### Theoretical Foundations

# Theoretical Foundations of scvi-tools

This document explains the mathematical and statistical principles underlying scvi-tools.

## Core Concepts

### Variational Inference

**What is it?**
Variational inference is a technique for approximating complex probability distributions. In single-cell analysis, we want to understand the posterior distribution p(z|x) - the probability of latent variables z given observed data x.

**Why use it?**
- Exact inference is computationally intractable for complex models
- Scales to large datasets (millions of cells)
- Provides uncertainty quantification
- Enables Bayesian reasoning about cell states

**How does it work?**
1. Define a simpler approximate distribution q(z|x) with learnable parameters
2. Minimize the KL divergence between q(z|x) and true posterior p(z|x)
3. Equivalent to maximizing the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO)

**ELBO Objective**:
```
ELBO = E_q[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x) || p(z))
       ↑                    ↑
  Reconstruction          Regularization
```

- **Reconstruction term**: Model should generate data similar to observed
- **Regularization term**: Latent representation should match prior

### Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)

**Architecture**:
```
x (observed data)
    ↓
[Encoder Neural Network]
    ↓
z (latent representation)
    ↓
[Decoder Neural Network]
    ↓
x̂ (reconstructed data)
```

**Encoder**: Maps cells (x) to latent space (z)
- Learns q(z|x), the approximate posterior
- Parameterized by neural network with learnable weights
- Outputs mean and variance of latent distribution

**Decoder**: Maps latent space (z) back to gene space
- Learns p(x|z), the likelihood
- Generates gene expression from latent representation
- Models count distributions (Negative Binomial, Zero-Inflated NB)

**Reparameterization Trick**:
- Allows backpropagation through stochastic sampling
- Sample z = μ + σ ⊙ ε, where ε ~ N(0,1)
- Enables end-to-end training with gradient descent

### Amortized Inference

**Concept**: Share encoder parameters across all cells.

**Traditional inference**: Learn separate latent variables for each cell
- n_cells × n_latent parameters
- Doesn't scale to large datasets

**Amortized inference**: Learn single encoder for all cells
- Fixed number of parameters regardless of cell count
- Enables fast inference on new cells
- Transfers learned patterns across dataset

**Benefits**:
- Scalable to millions of cells
- Fast inference on query data
- Leverages shared structure across cells
- Enables few-shot learning

## Statistical Modeling

### Count Data Distributions

Single-cell data are counts (integer-valued), requiring appropriate distributions.

#### Negative Binomial (NB)
```
x ~ NB(μ, θ)
```
- **μ (mean)**: Expected expression level
- **θ (dispersion)**: Controls variance
- **Variance**: Var(x) = μ + μ²/θ

**When to use**: Gene expression without zero-inflation
- More flexible than Poisson (allows overdispersion)
- Models technical and biological variation

#### Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB)
```
x ~ π·δ₀ + (1-π)·NB(μ, θ)
```
- **π (dropout rate)**: Probability of technical zero
- **δ₀**: Point mass at zero
- **NB(μ, θ)**: Expression when not dropped out

**When to use**: Sparse scRNA-seq data
- Models technical dropout separately from biological zeros
- Better fit for highly sparse data (e.g., 10x data)

#### Poisson
```
x ~ Poisson(μ)
```
- Simplest count distribution
- Mean equals variance: Var(x) = μ

**When to use**: Less common; ATAC-seq fragment counts
- More restrictive than NB
- Faster computation

### Batch Correction Framework

**Problem**: Technical variation confounds biological signal
- Different sequencing runs, protocols, labs
- Must remove technical effects while preserving biology

**scvi-tools approach**:
1. Encode batch as categorical variable s
2. Include s in generative model
3. Latent space z is batch-invariant
4. Decoder conditions on s for batch-specific effects

**Mathematical formulation**:
```
Encoder: q(z|x, s)  - batch-aware encoding
Latent: z           - batch-corrected representation
Decoder: p(x|z, s)  - batch-specific decoding
```

**Key insight**: Batch info flows through decoder, not latent space
- z captures biological variation
- s explains technical variation
- Separable biology and batch effects

### Deep Generative Modeling

**Generative model**: Learns p(x), the data distribution

**Process**:
1. Sample latent variable: z ~ p(z) = N(0, I)
2. Generate expression: x ~ p(x|z)
3. Joint distribution: p(x, z) = p(x|z)p(z)

**Benefits**:
- Generate synthetic cells
- Impute missing values
- Quantify uncertainty
- Perform counterfactual predictions

**Inference network**: Inverts generative process
- Given x, infer z
- q(z|x) approximates true posterior p(z|x)

## Model Architecture Details

### scVI Architecture

**Input**: Gene expression counts x ∈ ℕ^G (G genes)

**Encoder**:
```
h = ReLU(W₁·x + b₁)
μ_z = W₂·h + b₂
log σ²_z = W₃·h + b₃
z ~ N(μ_z, σ²_z)
```

**Latent space**: z ∈ ℝ^d (typically d=10-30)

**Decoder**:
```
h = ReLU(W₄·z + b₄)
μ = softmax(W₅·h + b₅) · library_size
θ = exp(W₆·h + b₆)
π = sigmoid(W₇·h + b₇)  # for ZINB
x ~ ZINB(μ, θ, π)
```

**Loss function (ELBO)**:
```
L = E_q[log p(x|z)] - KL(q(z|x) || N(0,I))
```

### Handling Covariates

**Categorical covariates** (batch, donor, etc.):
- One-hot encoded: s ∈ {0,1}^K
- Concatenate with latent: [z, s]
- Or use conditional layers

**Continuous covariates** (library size, percent_mito):
- Standardize to zero mean, unit variance
- Include in encoder and/or decoder

**Covariate injection strategies**:
- **Concatenation**: [z, s] fed to decoder
- **Deep injection**: s added at multiple layers
- **Conditional batch norm**: Batch-specific normalization

## Advanced Theoretical Concepts

### Transfer Learning (scArches)

**Concept**: Use pretrained model as initialization for new data

**Process**:
1. Train reference model on large dataset
2. Freeze encoder parameters
3. Fine-tune decoder on query data
4. Or fine-tune all with lower learning rate

**Why it works**:
- Encoder learns general cellular representations
- Decoder adapts to query-specific characteristics
- Prevents catastrophic forgetting

**Applications**:
- Query-to-reference mapping
- Few-shot learning for rare cell types
- Rapid analysis of new datasets

### Multi-Resolution Modeling (MrVI)

**Idea**: Separate shared and sample-specific variation

**Latent space decomposition**:
```
z = z_shared + z_sample
```
- **z_shared**: Common across samples
- **z_sample**: Sample-specific effects

**Hierarchical structure**:
```
Sample level: ρ_s ~ N(0, I)
Cell level: z_i ~ N(ρ_{s(i)}, σ²)
```

**Benefits**:
- Disentangle biological sources of variation
- Compare samples at different resolutions
- Identify sample-specific cell states

### Counterfactual Prediction

**Goal**: Predict outcome under different conditions

**Example**: "What would this cell look like if from different batch?"

**Method**:
1. Encode cell to latent: z = Encoder(x, s_original)
2. Decode with new condition: x_new = Decoder(z, s_new)
3. x_new is counterfactual prediction

**Applications**:
- Batch effect assessment
- Predicting treatment response
- In silico perturbation studies

### Posterior Predictive Distribution

**Definition**: Distribution of new data given observed data

```
p(x_new | x_observed) = ∫ p(x_new|z) q(z|x_observed) dz
```

**Estimation**: Sample z from q(z|x), generate x_new from p(x_new|z)

**Uses**:
- Uncertainty quantification
- Robust predictions
- Outlier detection

## Differential Expression Framework

### Bayesian Approach

**Traditional methods**: Compare point estimates
- Wilcoxon, t-test, etc.
- Ignore uncertainty
- Require pseudocounts

**scvi-tools approach**: Compare distributions
- Sample from posterior: μ_A ~ p(μ|x_A), μ_B ~ p(μ|x_B)
- Compute log fold-change: LFC = log(μ_B) - log(μ_A)
- Posterior distribution of LFC quantifies uncertainty

### Bayes Factor

**Definition**: Ratio of posterior odds to prior odds

```
BF = P(H₁|data) / P(H₀|data)
     ─────────────────────────
     P(H₁) / P(H₀)
```

**Interpretation**:
- BF > 3: Moderate evidence for H₁
- BF > 10: Strong evidence
- BF > 100: Decisive evidence

**In scvi-tools**: Used to rank genes by evidence for DE

### False Discovery Proportion (FDP)

**Goal**: Control expected false discovery rate

**Procedure**:
1. For each gene, compute posterior probability of DE
2. Rank genes by evidence (Bayes factor)
3. Select top k genes such that E[FDP] ≤ α

**Advantage over p-values**:
- Fully Bayesian
- Natural for posterior inference
- No arbitrary thresholds

## Implementation Details

### Optimization

**Optimizer**: Adam (adaptive learning rates)
- Default lr = 0.001
- Momentum parameters: β₁=0.9, β₂=0.999

**Training loop**:
1. Sample mini-batch of cells
2. Compute ELBO loss
3. Backpropagate gradients
4. Update parameters with Adam
5. Repeat until convergence

**Convergence criteria**:
- ELBO plateaus on validation set
- Early stopping prevents overfitting
- Typically 200-500 epochs

### Regularization

**KL annealing**: Gradually increase KL weight
- Prevents posterior collapse
- Starts at 0, increases to 1 over epochs

**Dropout**: Random neuron dropping during training
- Default: 0.1 dropout rate
- Prevents overfitting
- Improves generalization

**Weight decay**: L2 regularization on weights
- Prevents large weights
- Improves stability

### Scalability

**Mini-batch training**:
- Process subset of cells per iteration
- Batch size: 64-256 cells
- Enables scaling to millions of cells

**Stochastic optimization**:
- Estimates ELBO on mini-batches
- Unbiased gradient estimates
- Converges to optimal solution

**GPU acceleration**:
- Neural networks naturally parallelize
- Order of magnitude speedup
- Essential for large datasets

## Complete Workflow: Spatial Deconvolution with DestVI

```python
import scvi
import scanpy as sc
import squidpy as sq

# ===== Part 1: Prepare single-cell reference =====
# Load and process scRNA-seq reference
sc_adata = sc.read_h5ad("reference_scrna.h5ad")

# QC and filtering
sc.pp.filter_genes(sc_adata, min_cells=10)
sc.pp.highly_variable_genes(sc_adata, n_top_genes=4000)

# Train scVI on reference
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(
    sc_adata,
    layer="counts",
    batch_key="batch"
)

sc_model = scvi.model.SCVI(sc_adata)
sc_model.train(max_epochs=400)

# ===== Part 2: Load spatial data =====
spatial_adata = sc.read_visium("path/to/visium")
spatial_adata.var_names_make_unique()

# QC spatial data
sc.pp.filter_genes(spatial_adata, min_cells=10)

# ===== Part 3: Run DestVI =====
scvi.model.DESTVI.setup_anndata(
    spatial_adata,
    layer="counts"
)

destvi_model = scvi.model.DESTVI.from_rna_model(
    spatial_adata,
    sc_model,
    cell_type_key="cell_type"
)

destvi_model.train(max_epochs=2500)

# ===== Part 4: Extract results =====
# Get proportions
proportions = destvi_model.get_proportions()
spatial_adata.obsm["proportions"] = proportions

# Add proportions to .obs for easy plotting
for i, ct in enumerate(sc_model.adata.obs["cell_type"].cat.categories):
    spatial_adata.obs[f"prop_{ct}"] = proportions[:, i]

# ===== Part 5: Visualization =====
# Plot specific cell types
cell_types = ["T cells", "B cells", "Macrophages"]

for ct in cell_types:
    sc.pl.spatial(
        spatial_adata,
        color=f"prop_{ct}",
        title=f"{ct} proportions",
        spot_size=150,
        cmap="viridis"
    )

# ===== Part 6: Spatial analysis =====
# Compute spatial neighbors
sq.gr.spatial_neighbors(spatial_adata)

# Spatial autocorrelation of cell types
for ct in cell_types:
    sq.gr.spatial_autocorr(
        spatial_adata,
        attr="obs",
        mode="moran",
        genes=[f"prop_{ct}"]
    )

# ===== Part 7: Save results =====
destvi_model.save("destvi_model")
spatial_adata.write("spatial_deconvolved.h5ad")
```

## Best Practices for Spatial Analysis

1. **Reference quality**: Use high-quality, well-annotated scRNA-seq reference
2. **Gene overlap**: Ensure sufficient shared genes between reference and spatial
3. **Spatial coordinates**: Properly register spatial coordinates in `.obsm["spatial"]`
4. **Validation**: Use known marker genes to validate deconvolution
5. **Visualization**: Always visualize results spatially to check biological plausibility
6. **Cell type granularity**: Consider appropriate cell type resolution
7. **Computational resources**: Spatial models can be memory-intensive
8. **Quality control**: Filter low-quality spots before analysis




### Differential Expression

# Differential Expression Analysis in scvi-tools

This document provides detailed information about differential expression (DE) analysis using scvi-tools' probabilistic framework.

## Overview

scvi-tools implements Bayesian differential expression testing that leverages the learned generative models to estimate expression differences between groups. This approach provides several advantages over traditional methods:

- **Batch correction**: DE testing on batch-corrected representations
- **Uncertainty quantification**: Probabilistic estimates of effect sizes
- **Zero-inflation handling**: Proper modeling of dropout and zeros
- **Flexible comparisons**: Between any groups or cell types
- **Multiple modalities**: Works for RNA, proteins (totalVI), and accessibility (PeakVI)

## Core Statistical Framework

### Problem Definition

The goal is to estimate the log fold-change in expression between two conditions:

```
log fold-change = log(μ_B) - log(μ_A)
```

Where μ_A and μ_B are the mean expression levels in conditions A and B.

### Three-Stage Process

**Stage 1: Estimating Expression Levels**
- Sample from posterior distribution of cellular states
- Generate expression values from the learned generative model
- Aggregate across cells to get population-level estimates

**Stage 2: Detecting Relevant Features (Hypothesis Testing)**
- Test for differential expression using Bayesian framework
- Two testing modes available:
  - **"vanilla" mode**: Point null hypothesis (β = 0)
  - **"change" mode**: Composite hypothesis (|β| ≤ δ)

**Stage 3: Controlling False Discovery**
- Posterior expected False Discovery Proportion (FDP) control
- Selects maximum number of discoveries ensuring E[FDP] ≤ α

## Basic Usage

### Simple Two-Group Comparison

```python
import scvi

# After training a model
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()

# Compare two cell types
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells"
)

# View top DE genes
top_genes = de_results.sort_values("lfc_mean", ascending=False).head(20)
print(top_genes[["lfc_mean", "lfc_std", "bayes_factor", "is_de_fdr_0.05"]])
```

### One vs. Rest Comparison

```python
# Compare one group against all others
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells"  # No group2 = compare to rest
)
```

### All Pairwise Comparisons

```python
# Compare all cell types pairwise
all_comparisons = {}

cell_types = adata.obs["cell_type"].unique()

for ct1 in cell_types:
    for ct2 in cell_types:
        if ct1 != ct2:
            key = f"{ct1}_vs_{ct2}"
            all_comparisons[key] = model.differential_expression(
                groupby="cell_type",
                group1=ct1,
                group2=ct2
            )
```

## Key Parameters

### `groupby` (required)
Column in `adata.obs` defining groups to compare.

```python
# Must be a categorical variable
de_results = model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type")
```

### `group1` and `group2`
Groups to compare. If `group2` is None, compares `group1` to all others.

```python
# Specific comparison
de = model.differential_expression(groupby="condition", group1="treated", group2="control")

# One vs rest
de = model.differential_expression(groupby="cell_type", group1="T cells")
```

### `mode` (Hypothesis Testing Mode)

**"vanilla" mode** (default): Point null hypothesis
- Tests if β = 0 exactly
- More sensitive, but may find trivially small effects

**"change" mode**: Composite null hypothesis
- Tests if |β| ≤ δ
- Requires biologically meaningful change
- Reduces false discoveries of tiny effects

```python
# Change mode with minimum effect size
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells",
    mode="change",
    delta=0.25  # Minimum log fold-change
)
```

### `delta`
Minimum effect size threshold for "change" mode.
- Typical values: 0.25, 0.5, 0.7 (log scale)
- log2(1.5) ≈ 0.58 (1.5-fold change)
- log2(2) = 1.0 (2-fold change)

```python
# Require at least 1.5-fold change
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="condition",
    group1="disease",
    group2="healthy",
    mode="change",
    delta=0.58  # log2(1.5)
)
```

### `fdr_target`
False discovery rate threshold (default: 0.05)

```python
# More stringent FDR control
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    fdr_target=0.01
)
```

### `batch_correction`
Whether to perform batch correction during DE testing (default: True)

```python
# Test within a specific batch
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells",
    batch_correction=False
)
```

### `n_samples`
Number of posterior samples for estimation (default: 5000)
- More samples = more accurate but slower
- Reduce for speed, increase for precision

```python
# High precision analysis
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    n_samples=10000
)
```

## Interpreting Results

### Output Columns

The results DataFrame contains several important columns:

**Effect Size Estimates**:
- `lfc_mean`: Mean log fold-change
- `lfc_median`: Median log fold-change
- `lfc_std`: Standard deviation of log fold-change
- `lfc_min`: Lower bound of effect size
- `lfc_max`: Upper bound of effect size

**Statistical Significance**:
- `bayes_factor`: Bayes factor for differential expression
  - Higher values = stronger evidence
  - >3 often considered meaningful
- `is_de_fdr_0.05`: Boolean indicating if gene is DE at FDR 0.05
- `is_de_fdr_0.1`: Boolean indicating if gene is DE at FDR 0.1

**Expression Levels**:
- `mean1`: Mean expression in group 1
- `mean2`: Mean expression in group 2
- `non_zeros_proportion1`: Proportion of non-zero cells in group 1
- `non_zeros_proportion2`: Proportion of non-zero cells in group 2

### Example Interpretation

```python
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells"
)

# Find significantly upregulated genes in T cells
upreg_tcells = de_results[
    (de_results["is_de_fdr_0.05"]) &
    (de_results["lfc_mean"] > 0)
].sort_values("lfc_mean", ascending=False)

print(f"Upregulated genes in T cells: {len(upreg_tcells)}")
print(upreg_tcells.head(10))

# Find genes with large effect sizes
large_effect = de_results[
    (de_results["is_de_fdr_0.05"]) &
    (abs(de_results["lfc_mean"]) > 1)  # 2-fold change
]
```

## Advanced Usage

### DE Within Specific Cells

```python
# Test DE only within a subset of cells
subset_indices = adata.obs["tissue"] == "lung"

de = model.differential_expression(
    idx1=adata.obs["cell_type"] == "T cells" & subset_indices,
    idx2=adata.obs["cell_type"] == "B cells" & subset_indices
)
```

### Batch-Specific DE

```python
# Test DE within each batch separately
batches = adata.obs["batch"].unique()

batch_de_results = {}
for batch in batches:
    batch_idx = adata.obs["batch"] == batch
    batch_de_results[batch] = model.differential_expression(
        idx1=(adata.obs["condition"] == "treated") & batch_idx,
        idx2=(adata.obs["condition"] == "control") & batch_idx
    )
```

### Pseudo-bulk DE

```python
# Aggregate cells before DE testing
# Useful for low cell counts per group

de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="rare_cell_type",
    group2="common_cell_type",
    n_samples=10000,  # More samples for stability
    batch_correction=True
)
```

## Visualization

### Volcano Plot

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="condition",
    group1="treated",
    group2="control"
)

# Volcano plot
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(
    de["lfc_mean"],
    -np.log10(1 / (de["bayes_factor"] + 1)),
    c=de["is_de_fdr_0.05"],
    cmap="coolwarm",
    alpha=0.5
)
plt.xlabel("Log Fold Change")
plt.ylabel("-log10(1/Bayes Factor)")
plt.title("Volcano Plot: Treated vs Control")
plt.axvline(x=0, color='k', linestyle='--', linewidth=0.5)
plt.show()
```

### Heatmap of Top DE Genes

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Get top DE genes
top_genes = de.sort_values("lfc_mean", ascending=False).head(50).index

# Get normalized expression
norm_expr = model.get_normalized_expression(
    adata,
    indices=adata.obs["condition"].isin(["treated", "control"]),
    gene_list=top_genes
)

# Plot heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 10))
sns.heatmap(
    norm_expr.T,
    cmap="viridis",
    xticklabels=False,
    yticklabels=top_genes
)
plt.title("Top 50 DE Genes")
plt.show()
```

### Ranked Gene Plot

```python
# Plot genes ranked by effect size
de_sorted = de.sort_values("lfc_mean", ascending=False)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
plt.plot(range(len(de_sorted)), de_sorted["lfc_mean"].values)
plt.axhline(y=0, color='r', linestyle='--')
plt.xlabel("Gene Rank")
plt.ylabel("Log Fold Change")
plt.title("Genes Ranked by Effect Size")
plt.show()
```

## Comparison with Traditional Methods

### scvi-tools vs. Wilcoxon Test

```python
import scanpy as sc

# Traditional Wilcoxon test
sc.tl.rank_genes_groups(
    adata,
    groupby="cell_type",
    method="wilcoxon",
    key_added="wilcoxon"
)

# scvi-tools DE
de_scvi = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells"
)

# Compare results
wilcox_results = sc.get.rank_genes_groups_df(adata, group="T cells", key="wilcoxon")
```

**Advantages of scvi-tools**:
- Accounts for batch effects automatically
- Handles zero-inflation properly
- Provides uncertainty quantification
- No arbitrary pseudocount needed
- Better statistical properties

**When to use Wilcoxon**:
- Very quick exploratory analysis
- Comparison with published results using Wilcoxon

## Multi-Modal DE

### Protein DE (totalVI)

```python
# Train totalVI on CITE-seq data
totalvi_model = scvi.model.TOTALVI(adata)
totalvi_model.train()

# RNA differential expression
rna_de = totalvi_model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells",
    protein_expression=False  # Default
)

# Protein differential expression
protein_de = totalvi_model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells",
    protein_expression=True
)

print(f"DE genes: {rna_de['is_de_fdr_0.05'].sum()}")
print(f"DE proteins: {protein_de['is_de_fdr_0.05'].sum()}")
```

### Differential Accessibility (PeakVI)

```python
# Train PeakVI on ATAC-seq data
peakvi_model = scvi.model.PEAKVI(atac_adata)
peakvi_model.train()

# Differential accessibility
da = peakvi_model.differential_accessibility(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    group2="B cells"
)

# Same interpretation as DE
```

## Handling Special Cases

### Low Cell Count Groups

```python
# Increase posterior samples for stability
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="rare_type",  # e.g., 50 cells
    group2="common_type",  # e.g., 5000 cells
    n_samples=10000
)
```

### Imbalanced Comparisons

```python
# When groups have very different sizes
# Use change mode to avoid tiny effects

de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="condition",
    group1="rare_condition",
    group2="common_condition",
    mode="change",
    delta=0.5
)
```

### Multiple Testing Correction

```python
# Already included via FDP control
# But can apply additional corrections

from statsmodels.stats.multitest import multipletests

# Bonferroni correction (very conservative)
_, pvals_corrected, _, _ = multipletests(
    1 / (de["bayes_factor"] + 1),
    method="bonferroni"
)
```

## Performance Considerations

### Speed Optimization

```python
# Faster DE testing for large datasets
de = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="T cells",
    n_samples=1000,  # Reduce samples
    batch_size=512    # Increase batch size
)
```

### Memory Management

```python
# For very large datasets
# Test one comparison at a time rather than all pairwise

cell_types = adata.obs["cell_type"].unique()
for ct in cell_types:
    de = model.differential_expression(
        groupby="cell_type",
        group1=ct
    )
    # Save results
    de.to_csv(f"de_results_{ct}.csv")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use "change" mode**: For biologically interpretable results
2. **Set appropriate delta**: Based on biological significance
3. **Check expression levels**: Filter lowly expressed genes
4. **Validate findings**: Check marker genes for sanity
5. **Visualize results**: Always plot top DE genes
6. **Report parameters**: Document mode, delta, FDR used
7. **Consider batch effects**: Use batch_correction=True
8. **Multiple comparisons**: Be aware of testing many groups
9. **Sample size**: Ensure sufficient cells per group (>50 recommended)
10. **Biological validation**: Follow up with functional experiments

## Example: Complete DE Analysis Workflow

```python
import scvi
import scanpy as sc
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# 1. Train model
scvi.model.SCVI.setup_anndata(adata, layer="counts", batch_key="batch")
model = scvi.model.SCVI(adata)
model.train()

# 2. Perform DE analysis
de_results = model.differential_expression(
    groupby="cell_type",
    group1="Disease_T_cells",
    group2="Healthy_T_cells",
    mode="change",
    delta=0.5,
    fdr_target=0.05
)

# 3. Filter and analyze
sig_genes = de_results[de_results["is_de_fdr_0.05"]]
upreg = sig_genes[sig_genes["lfc_mean"] > 0].sort_values("lfc_mean", ascending=False)
downreg = sig_genes[sig_genes["lfc_mean"] < 0].sort_values("lfc_mean")

print(f"Significant genes: {len(sig_genes)}")
print(f"Upregulated: {len(upreg)}")
print(f"Downregulated: {len(downreg)}")

# 4. Visualize top genes
top_genes = upreg.head(10).index.tolist() + downreg.head(10).index.tolist()

sc.pl.violin(
    adata[adata.obs["cell_type"].isin(["Disease_T_cells", "Healthy_T_cells"])],
    keys=top_genes,
    groupby="cell_type",
    rotation=90
)

# 5. Functional enrichment (using external tools)
# E.g., g:Profiler, DAVID, or gprofiler-official Python package
upreg_genes = upreg.head(100).index.tolist()
# Perform pathway analysis...

# 6. Save results
de_results.to_csv("de_results_disease_vs_healthy.csv")
upreg.to_csv("upregulated_genes.csv")
downreg.to_csv("downregulated_genes.csv")
```
