```

## Analysis Modes

NeuroKit2 automatically selects between two analysis modes based on data duration:

**Event-related analysis** (< 10 seconds):
- Analyzes stimulus-locked responses
- Epoch-based segmentation
- Suitable for experimental paradigms with discrete trials

**Interval-related analysis** (≥ 10 seconds):
- Characterizes physiological patterns over extended periods
- Resting state or continuous activities
- Suitable for baseline measurements and long-term monitoring

Most `*_analyze()` functions automatically choose the appropriate mode.

## Installation

```bash
uv pip install neurokit2
```

### Bio_Module

# Multi-Signal Integration (Bio Module)

## Overview

The Bio module provides unified functions for processing and analyzing multiple physiological signals simultaneously. It acts as a wrapper that coordinates signal-specific processing functions and enables integrated multi-modal analysis.

## Multi-Signal Processing

### bio_process()

Process multiple physiological signals simultaneously with a single function call.

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=None, rsp=None, eda=None, emg=None,
                                       ppg=None, eog=None, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Parameters:**
- `ecg`: ECG signal array (optional)
- `rsp`: Respiratory signal array (optional)
- `eda`: EDA signal array (optional)
- `emg`: EMG signal array (optional)
- `ppg`: PPG signal array (optional)
- `eog`: EOG signal array (optional)
- `sampling_rate`: Sampling rate in Hz (must be consistent across signals or specify per signal)

**Returns:**
- `bio_signals`: Unified DataFrame containing all processed signals with columns:
  - Signal-specific features (e.g., `ECG_Clean`, `ECG_Rate`, `EDA_Phasic`, `RSP_Rate`)
  - All detected events/peaks
  - Derived measures
- `bio_info`: Dictionary with signal-specific information (peak locations, parameters)

**Example:**
```python
# Process ECG, respiration, and EDA simultaneously
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg_signal,
    rsp=rsp_signal,
    eda=eda_signal,
    sampling_rate=1000
)

# Access processed signals
ecg_clean = bio_signals['ECG_Clean']
rsp_rate = bio_signals['RSP_Rate']
eda_phasic = bio_signals['EDA_Phasic']

# Access detected peaks
ecg_peaks = bio_info['ECG']['ECG_R_Peaks']
rsp_peaks = bio_info['RSP']['RSP_Peaks']
```

**Internal workflow:**
1. Each signal is processed by its dedicated processing function:
   - `ecg_process()` for ECG
   - `rsp_process()` for respiration
   - `eda_process()` for EDA
   - `emg_process()` for EMG
   - `ppg_process()` for PPG
   - `eog_process()` for EOG
2. Results are merged into unified DataFrame
3. Cross-signal features computed (e.g., RSA if both ECG and RSP present)

**Advantages:**
- Simplified API for multi-modal recording
- Unified time base for all signals
- Automatic cross-signal feature computation
- Consistent output format

## Multi-Signal Analysis

### bio_analyze()

Perform comprehensive analysis on processed multi-modal signals.

```python
bio_results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Parameters:**
- `bio_signals`: DataFrame from `bio_process()` or custom processed signals
- `sampling_rate`: Sampling rate (Hz)

**Returns:**
- DataFrame with analysis results for all detected signal types:
  - Interval-related metrics if duration ≥ 10 seconds
  - Event-related metrics if duration < 10 seconds
  - Cross-signal indices (e.g., RSA if ECG + RSP available)

**Computed metrics by signal:**
- **ECG**: Heart rate statistics, HRV indices (time, frequency, nonlinear domains)
- **RSP**: Respiratory rate statistics, RRV, amplitude measures
- **EDA**: SCR count, amplitude, tonic level, sympathetic indices
- **EMG**: Activation count, amplitude statistics
- **PPG**: Similar to ECG (heart rate, HRV)
- **EOG**: Blink count, blink rate

**Cross-signal metrics:**
- **RSA (Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia)**: If ECG + RSP present
- **Cardiorespiratory coupling**: Phase synchronization indices
- **Multi-modal arousal**: Combined autonomic indices

**Example:**
```python
# Analyze processed signals
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

# Access results
heart_rate_mean = results['ECG_Rate_Mean']
hrv_rmssd = results['HRV_RMSSD']
breathing_rate = results['RSP_Rate_Mean']
scr_count = results['SCR_Peaks_N']
rsa_value = results['RSA']  # If both ECG and RSP present
```

## Cross-Signal Features

When multiple signals are processed together, NeuroKit2 can compute integrated features:

### Respiratory Sinus Arrhythmia (RSA)

Automatically computed when both ECG and respiratory signals are present.

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, rsp=rsp, sampling_rate=1000)
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

rsa = results['RSA']  # Automatically included
```

**Computation:**
- High-frequency HRV modulation by breathing
- Requires synchronized ECG R-peaks and respiratory signal
- Methods: Porges-Bohrer or peak-to-trough

**Interpretation:**
- Higher RSA: greater parasympathetic (vagal) influence
- Marker of cardiac-respiratory coupling
- Health indicator and emotion regulation capacity

### ECG-Derived Respiration (EDR)

If respiratory signal unavailable, NeuroKit2 can estimate from ECG:

```python
ecg_signals, ecg_info = nk.ecg_process(ecg, sampling_rate=1000)

# Extract EDR
edr = nk.ecg_rsp(ecg_signals['ECG_Clean'], sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Use case:**
- Estimate respiration when direct measurement unavailable
- Cross-validate respiratory measurements

### Cardio-EDA Integration

Synchronized cardiac and electrodermal activity:

```python
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, eda=eda, sampling_rate=1000)

# Both signals available for integrated analysis
ecg_rate = bio_signals['ECG_Rate']
eda_phasic = bio_signals['EDA_Phasic']

# Compute correlations or coupling metrics
correlation = ecg_rate.corr(eda_phasic)
```

## Practical Workflows

### Complete Multi-Modal Recording Analysis

```python
import neurokit2 as nk
import pandas as pd

# 1. Load multi-modal physiological data
ecg = load_ecg()        # Your data loading function
rsp = load_rsp()
eda = load_eda()
emg = load_emg()

# 2. Process all signals simultaneously
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg,
    rsp=rsp,
    eda=eda,
    emg=emg,
    sampling_rate=1000
)

# 3. Visualize processed signals
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, axes = plt.subplots(4, 1, figsize=(15, 12), sharex=True)

# ECG
axes[0].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['ECG_Clean'])
axes[0].set_ylabel('ECG')
axes[0].set_title('Multi-Modal Physiological Recording')

# Respiration
axes[1].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['RSP_Clean'])
axes[1].set_ylabel('Respiration')

# EDA
axes[2].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['EDA_Phasic'])
axes[2].set_ylabel('EDA (Phasic)')

# EMG
axes[3].plot(bio_signals.index / 1000, bio_signals['EMG_Amplitude'])
axes[3].set_ylabel('EMG Amplitude')
axes[3].set_xlabel('Time (s)')

plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# 4. Analyze all signals
results = nk.bio_analyze(bio_signals, sampling_rate=1000)

# 5. Extract key metrics
print("Heart Rate (mean):", results['ECG_Rate_Mean'])
print("HRV (RMSSD):", results['HRV_RMSSD'])
print("Breathing Rate:", results['RSP_Rate_Mean'])
print("SCRs (count):", results['SCR_Peaks_N'])
print("RSA:", results['RSA'])
```

### Event-Related Multi-Modal Analysis

```python
# 1. Process signals
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(ecg=ecg, rsp=rsp, eda=eda, sampling_rate=1000)

# 2. Detect events
events = nk.events_find(trigger_channel, threshold=0.5)

# 3. Create epochs for all signals
epochs = nk.epochs_create(bio_signals, events, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-1.0, epochs_end=10.0,
                          event_labels=event_labels,
                          event_conditions=event_conditions)

# 4. Signal-specific event-related analysis
ecg_eventrelated = nk.ecg_eventrelated(epochs)
rsp_eventrelated = nk.rsp_eventrelated(epochs)
eda_eventrelated = nk.eda_eventrelated(epochs)

# 5. Merge results
all_results = pd.merge(ecg_eventrelated, rsp_eventrelated,
                       left_index=True, right_index=True)
all_results = pd.merge(all_results, eda_eventrelated,
                       left_index=True, right_index=True)

# 6. Statistical comparison by condition
all_results['Condition'] = event_conditions
condition_means = all_results.groupby('Condition').mean()
```

### Different Sampling Rates

Handle signals with different native sampling rates:

```python
# ECG at 1000 Hz, EDA at 100 Hz
bio_signals, bio_info = nk.bio_process(
    ecg=ecg_1000hz,
    eda=eda_100hz,
    sampling_rate=1000  # Target sampling rate
)
# EDA will be automatically resampled to 1000 Hz internally
```

Or process separately and merge:

```python
# Process at native sampling rates
ecg_signals, ecg_info = nk.ecg_process(ecg, sampling_rate=1000)
eda_signals, eda_info = nk.eda_process(eda, sampling_rate=100)

# Resample to common rate
eda_resampled = nk.signal_resample(eda_signals, sampling_rate=100,
                                   desired_sampling_rate=1000)

# Merge manually
bio_signals = pd.concat([ecg_signals, eda_resampled], axis=1)
```

## Use Cases and Applications

### Comprehensive Psychophysiology Research

Capture multiple dimensions of physiological arousal:

- **Cardiac**: Orienting, attention, emotional valence
- **Respiratory**: Arousal, stress, emotion regulation
- **EDA**: Sympathetic arousal, emotional intensity
- **EMG**: Muscle tension, facial expression, startle

**Example: Emotional picture viewing**
- ECG: Heart rate deceleration during picture viewing (attention)
- EDA: SCRs reflect emotional arousal intensity
- RSP: Breath-holding or changes reflect emotional engagement
- Facial EMG: Corrugator (frown), zygomaticus (smile) for valence

### Stress and Relaxation Assessment

Multi-modal markers provide convergent evidence:

- **Increased stress**: ↑ HR, ↓ HRV, ↑ EDA, ↑ respiration rate, ↑ muscle tension
- **Relaxation**: ↓ HR, ↑ HRV, ↓ EDA, ↓ respiration rate, slow breathing, ↓ muscle tension

**Intervention effectiveness:**
- Compare multi-modal indices before vs. after intervention
- Identify which modalities respond to specific techniques

### Clinical Assessment

**Anxiety disorders:**
- Heightened baseline EDA, HR
- Exaggerated responses to stressors
- Reduced HRV, respiratory variability

**Depression:**
- Altered autonomic balance (↓ HRV)
- Blunted EDA responses
- Irregular respiratory patterns

**PTSD:**
- Hyperarousal (↑ HR, ↑ EDA baseline)
- Exaggerated startle (EMG)
- Altered RSA

### Human-Computer Interaction

Unobtrusive user state assessment:

- **Cognitive load**: ↓ HRV, ↑ EDA, suppressed blinks
- **Frustration**: ↑ HR, ↑ EDA, ↑ muscle tension
- **Engagement**: Moderate arousal, synchronized responses
- **Boredom**: Low arousal, irregular patterns

### Athletic Performance and Recovery

Monitor training load and recovery:

- **Resting HRV**: Daily monitoring for overtraining
- **EDA**: Sympathetic activation and stress
- **Respiration**: Breathing patterns during exercise/recovery
- **Multi-modal integration**: Comprehensive recovery assessment

## Advantages of Multi-Modal Recording

**Convergent validity:**
- Multiple indices converge on same construct (e.g., arousal)
- More robust than single measure

**Discriminant validity:**
- Different signals dissociate under certain conditions
- ECG reflects both sympathetic and parasympathetic
- EDA reflects primarily sympathetic

**System integration:**
- Understand whole-body physiological coordination
- Cross-signal coupling metrics (RSA, coherence)

**Redundancy and robustness:**
- If one signal quality poor, others available
- Cross-validate findings across modalities

**Richer interpretation:**
- HR deceleration + SCR increase = orienting with arousal
- HR acceleration + no SCR = cardiac response without sympathetic arousal

## Considerations

### Hardware and Synchronization

- **Same device**: Signals inherently synchronized
- **Different devices**: Requires common trigger/timestamp
  - Use hardware trigger to mark simultaneous events
  - Software alignment based on event markers
  - Verify synchronization quality (cross-correlate redundant signals)

### Signal Quality Across Modalities

- Not all signals may have equal quality
- Prioritize based on research question
- Document quality issues per signal

### Computational Cost

- Processing multiple signals increases computation time
- Consider processing in batches for large datasets
- Downsample appropriately to reduce load

### Analysis Complexity

- More signals = more variables = more statistical comparisons
- Risk of Type I error (false positives) without correction
- Use multivariate approaches or pre-registered analyses

### Interpretation

- Avoid over-interpretation of complex multi-modal patterns
- Ground in physiological theory
- Replicate findings before strong claims

### Epochs_Events

# Epochs and Event-Related Analysis

## Overview

Event-related analysis examines physiological responses time-locked to specific stimuli or events. NeuroKit2 provides tools for event detection, epoch creation, averaging, and event-related feature extraction across all signal types.

## Event Detection

### events_find()

```python
# Trigger channel: 0V baseline, 5V pulses during events
events = nk.events_find(trigger_channel, threshold=2.5, threshold_keep='above')
```

**Button presses:**
```python
# Detect when button signal goes high
button_events = nk.events_find(button_signal, threshold=0.5, threshold_keep='above',
                               duration_min=10)  # Debounce
```

**State changes:**
```python
# Detect periods above/below threshold
high_arousal = nk.events_find(eda_signal, threshold='auto', duration_min=100)
```

### events_plot()

## Epoch Creation

### epochs_create()

Create epochs (segments) of data around events for event-related analysis.

```python
epochs = nk.epochs_create(data, events, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-0.5, epochs_end=2.0,
                          event_labels=None, event_conditions=None,
                          baseline_correction=False)
```

**Parameters:**
- `data`: DataFrame with signals or single signal
- `events`: Event indices or dictionary from `events_find()`
- `sampling_rate`: Signal sampling rate (Hz)
- `epochs_start`: Start time relative to event (seconds, negative = before)
- `epochs_end`: End time relative to event (seconds, positive = after)
- `event_labels`: List of labels for each event (optional)
- `event_conditions`: List of condition names for each event (optional)
- `baseline_correction`: If True, subtract baseline mean from each epoch

**Returns:**

- Includes `'Label'` and `'Condition'` columns if provided

**Typical epoch windows:**
- **Visual ERP**: -0.2 to 1.0 seconds (200 ms baseline, 1 s post-stimulus)
- **Cardiac orienting**: -1.0 to 10 seconds (capture anticipation and response)
- **EMG startle**: -0.1 to 0.5 seconds (brief response)
- **EDA SCR**: -1.0 to 10 seconds (1-3 s latency, slow recovery)

### Event Labels and Conditions

Organize events by type and experimental conditions:

```python
# Example: Emotional picture experiment
event_times = [1000, 2500, 4200, 5800]  # Event onsets in samples
event_labels = ['trial1', 'trial2', 'trial3', 'trial4']
event_conditions = ['positive', 'negative', 'positive', 'neutral']

epochs = nk.epochs_create(signals, events=event_times, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-1, epochs_end=5,
                          event_labels=event_labels,
                          event_conditions=event_conditions)
```

**Access epochs:**
```python
# Epoch by number
epoch_1 = epochs['1']

# Filter by condition
positive_epochs = {k: v for k, v in epochs.items() if v['Condition'][0] == 'positive'}
```

### Baseline Correction

Remove pre-stimulus baseline from epochs to isolate event-related changes:

**Automatic (during epoch creation):**
```python
epochs = nk.epochs_create(data, events, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-0.5, epochs_end=2.0,
                          baseline_correction=True)  # Subtracts mean of entire baseline
```

**Manual (after epoch creation):**
```python
# Subtract baseline period mean
baseline_start = -0.5  # seconds
baseline_end = 0.0     # seconds

for key, epoch in epochs.items():
    baseline_mask = (epoch.index >= baseline_start) & (epoch.index < baseline_end)
    baseline_mean = epoch[baseline_mask].mean()
    epochs[key] = epoch - baseline_mean
```

**When to baseline correct:**
- **ERPs**: Always (isolates event-related change)
- **Cardiac/EDA**: Usually (removes inter-individual baseline differences)
- **Absolute measures**: Sometimes not desired (e.g., analyzing absolute amplitude)

```

### Handling Multiple Event Types

```python
# Different event types with different markers
event_type1 = nk.events_find(trigger_ch1, threshold=0.5)
event_type2 = nk.events_find(trigger_ch2, threshold=0.5)

# Combine events with labels
all_events = np.concatenate([event_type1['onset'], event_type2['onset']])
event_labels = ['type1'] * len(event_type1['onset']) + ['type2'] * len(event_type2['onset'])

# Sort by time
sort_idx = np.argsort(all_events)
all_events = all_events[sort_idx]
event_labels = [event_labels[i] for i in sort_idx]

# Create epochs
epochs = nk.epochs_create(signals, all_events, sampling_rate=1000,
                          epochs_start=-0.5, epochs_end=3.0,
                          event_labels=event_labels)

# Separate by type
type1_epochs = {k: v for k, v in epochs.items() if v['Label'][0] == 'type1'}
type2_epochs = {k: v for k, v in epochs.items() if v['Label'][0] == 'type2'}
```

### Quality Control and Artifact Rejection

```python
# Remove epochs with excessive noise or artifacts
clean_epochs = {}
for key, epoch in epochs.items():
    # Example: reject if EDA amplitude too high (movement artifact)
    if epoch['EDA_Phasic'].abs().max() < 5.0:  # Threshold
        # Example: reject if heart rate change too large (invalid)
        if epoch['ECG_Rate'].max() - epoch['ECG_Rate'].min() < 50:
            clean_epochs[key] = epoch

print(f"Kept {len(clean_epochs)}/{len(epochs)} epochs")

# Analyze clean epochs
results = nk.ecg_eventrelated(clean_epochs)
```

## Statistical Considerations

### Sample Size
- **ERP/averaging**: 20-30+ trials per condition minimum
- **Individual trial analysis**: Mixed-effects models handle variable trial counts
- **Group comparisons**: Pilot data for power analysis

### Time Window Selection
- **A priori hypotheses**: Pre-register time windows based on literature
- **Exploratory**: Use full epoch, correct for multiple comparisons
- **Avoid**: Selecting windows based on observed data (circular)

### Baseline Period
- Should be free of anticipatory effects
- Sufficient duration for stable estimate (500-1000 ms typical)
- Shorter for fast dynamics (e.g., startle: 100 ms sufficient)

### Condition Comparison
- Repeated measures ANOVA for within-subject designs
- Mixed-effects models for unbalanced data
- Permutation tests for non-parametric comparisons
- Correct for multiple comparisons (time points/signals)

## Common Applications

**Cognitive psychology:**
- P300 ERP analysis
- Error-related negativity (ERN)
- Attentional blink
- Working memory load effects

**Affective neuroscience:**
- Emotional picture viewing (EDA, HR, facial EMG)
- Fear conditioning (HR deceleration, SCR)

## Practical Considerations

### Signal Length Requirements

| DFA | 500 | 1000+ |
| Lyapunov | 1000 | 5000+ |
| Correlation dimension | 1000 | 5000+ |

### Parameter Selection

**General guidelines:**
- Use parameter optimization functions first
- Or use conventional defaults:
  - Delay (τ): 1 for HRV, autocorrelation first minimum for EEG
  - Dimension (m): 2-3 typical
  - Tolerance (r): 0.2 × SD common

**Sensitivity:**
- Results can be parameter-sensitive
- Report parameters used
- Consider sensitivity analysis

### Normalization and Preprocessing

**Standardization:**
- Many measures sensitive to signal amplitude
- Z-score normalization often recommended
- Detrending may be necessary

**Stationarity:**
- Some measures assume stationarity
- Check with statistical tests (e.g., ADF test)
- Segment non-stationary signals

### Interpretation

**Context-dependent:**
- No universal "good" or "bad" complexity
- Compare within-subject or between groups

- Algorithm parameters: adjust threshold
- Try alternative detection methods

### Best Practices

**Standard workflow:**
```python
# 1. Clean signal
cleaned = nk.ppg_clean(ppg_raw, sampling_rate=100, method='elgendi')

# 2. Detect peaks with artifact correction
peaks, info = nk.ppg_peaks(cleaned, sampling_rate=100, correct_artifacts=True)

# 3. Assess quality
quality = nk.ppg_quality(cleaned, sampling_rate=100)

# 4. Comprehensive processing (alternative)
signals, info = nk.ppg_process(ppg_raw, sampling_rate=100)

# 5. Analyze
analysis = nk.ppg_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=100)
```

**HRV from PPG:**
```python
# Process PPG signal
signals, info = nk.ppg_process(ppg_raw, sampling_rate=100)

# Extract peaks and compute HRV
hrv_indices = nk.hrv(info['PPG_Peaks'], sampling_rate=100)

# PPG-derived HRV is valid but may differ slightly from ECG-derived HRV
# Differences due to pulse arrival time, vascular properties
```

- Motion artifacts more common: validate with signal quality

**Pulse amplitude:**
- Reflects peripheral perfusion
- Increases: vasodilation, warmth
- Decreases: vasoconstriction, cold, stress, poor contact

**Pulse morphology:**
- Systolic peak: Cardiac ejection
- Dicrotic notch: Aortic valve closure, arterial compliance
- Aging/stiffness: Earlier, more prominent dicrotic notch

epochs = nk.epochs_create(signals, events, sampling_rate=100,
                          epochs_start=-1, epochs_end=10)

# 4. Event-related analysis

### Emg

# Electromyography (EMG) Analysis

## Overview

Electromyography (EMG) measures electrical activity produced by skeletal muscles during contraction. EMG analysis in NeuroKit2 focuses on amplitude estimation, muscle activation detection, and temporal dynamics for psychophysiology and motor control research.

## Main Processing Pipeline

### emg_process()

Automated EMG signal processing pipeline.

```python
signals, info = nk.emg_process(emg_signal, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Pipeline steps:**
1. Signal cleaning (high-pass filtering, detrending)
2. Amplitude envelope extraction
3. Muscle activation detection
4. Onset and offset identification

**Returns:**
- `signals`: DataFrame with:
  - `EMG_Clean`: Filtered EMG signal
  - `EMG_Amplitude`: Linear envelope (smoothed rectified signal)
  - `EMG_Activity`: Binary activation indicator (0/1)
  - `EMG_Onsets`: Activation onset markers
  - `EMG_Offsets`: Activation offset markers
- `info`: Dictionary with activation parameters

**Typical workflow:**
- Process raw EMG → Extract amplitude → Detect activations → Analyze features

## Preprocessing Functions

### emg_clean()

Apply filtering to remove noise and prepare for amplitude extraction.

```python
cleaned_emg = nk.emg_clean(emg_signal, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Filtering approach (BioSPPy method):**
- Fourth-order Butterworth high-pass filter (100 Hz)
- Removes low-frequency movement artifacts and baseline drift
- Removes DC offset
- Signal detrending

**Rationale:**
- EMG frequency content: 20-500 Hz (dominant: 50-150 Hz)
- High-pass at 100 Hz isolates muscle activity
- Removes ECG contamination (especially in trunk muscles)
- Removes motion artifacts (<20 Hz)

**EMG signal characteristics:**
- Random, zero-mean oscillations during contraction
- Higher amplitude = stronger contraction
- Raw EMG: both positive and negative deflections

## Feature Extraction

### emg_amplitude()

Compute linear envelope representing muscle contraction intensity.

```python
amplitude = nk.emg_amplitude(cleaned_emg, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Method:**

2. Low-pass filtering (smooth envelope)
3. Downsampling (optional)

**Linear envelope:**
- Smooth curve following EMG amplitude modulation
- Represents muscle force/activation level
- Suitable for further analysis (activation detection, integration)

**Typical smoothing:**
- Low-pass filter: 10-20 Hz cutoff
- Moving average: 50-200 ms window
- Balance: responsiveness vs. smoothness

## Activation Detection

**2. Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM):**
```python
activity = nk.emg_activation(amplitude, method='mixture', n_clusters=2)
```

**3. Changepoint detection:**
```python
activity = nk.emg_activation(amplitude, method='changepoint')
```
- Detects abrupt transitions in signal properties

## Practical Considerations

### Sampling Rate Recommendations
- **Minimum**: 500 Hz (Nyquist for 250 Hz upper frequency)
- **Standard**: 1000 Hz (most research applications)
- **High-resolution**: 2000-4000 Hz (detailed motor unit studies)
- **Surface EMG**: 1000-2000 Hz typical
- **Intramuscular EMG**: 10,000+ Hz for single motor units

### Recording Duration
- **Event-related**: Depends on paradigm (e.g., 2-5 seconds per trial)
- **Sustained contraction**: Seconds to minutes
- **Fatigue studies**: Minutes to hours
- **Chronic monitoring**: Days (wearable EMG)

### Electrode Placement

**Surface EMG (most common):**
- Bipolar configuration (two electrodes over muscle belly)
- Reference/ground electrode over electrically neutral site (bone)
- Skin preparation: clean, abrade, reduce impedance
- Inter-electrode distance: 10-20 mm (SENIAM standards)

**Muscle-specific guidelines:**
- Follow SENIAM (Surface EMG for Non-Invasive Assessment of Muscles) recommendations
- Palpate muscle during contraction to locate belly
- Align electrodes with muscle fiber direction

**Common muscles in psychophysiology:**
- **Corrugator supercilii**: Frowning, negative affect (above eyebrow)
- **Zygomaticus major**: Smiling, positive affect (cheek)
- **Orbicularis oculi**: Startle response, fear (around eye)
- **Masseter**: Jaw clenching, stress (jaw muscle)
- **Trapezius**: Shoulder tension, stress (upper back)
- **Frontalis**: Forehead tension, surprise

### Signal Quality Issues

**ECG contamination:**
- Common in trunk and proximal muscles
- High-pass filtering (>100 Hz) usually sufficient
- If persistent: template subtraction, ICA

**Motion artifacts:**
- Low-frequency disturbances
- Electrode cable movement
- Secure electrodes, minimize cable motion

**Electrode issues:**
- Poor contact: high impedance, low amplitude
- Sweat: gradual amplitude increase, instability
- Hair: clean or shave area

**Cross-talk:**
- Adjacent muscle activity bleeding into recording
- Careful electrode placement
- Small inter-electrode distance

### Best Practices

**Standard workflow:**
```python
# 1. Clean signal (high-pass filter, detrend)
cleaned = nk.emg_clean(emg_raw, sampling_rate=1000)

# 2. Extract amplitude envelope
amplitude = nk.emg_amplitude(cleaned, sampling_rate=1000)

# 3. Detect activation periods
activity, info = nk.emg_activation(amplitude, sampling_rate=1000,
                                   method='threshold', threshold='auto')

# 4. Comprehensive processing (alternative)
signals, info = nk.emg_process(emg_raw, sampling_rate=1000)

# 5. Analyze
analysis = nk.emg_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=1000)
```

**Normalization:**
```python
# Maximum voluntary contraction (MVC) normalization
mvc_amplitude = np.max(mvc_emg_amplitude)  # From separate MVC trial
normalized_emg = (amplitude / mvc_amplitude) * 100  # Express as % MVC

# Common in ergonomics, exercise physiology
# Allows comparison across individuals and sessions
```

## Clinical and Research Applications

- Intramuscular EMG
- Spike detection and sorting
- Firing rate analysis
- Requires high sampling rates (10+ kHz)

- Relationship to force: sigmoid, influenced by many factors
- Within-subject comparisons most reliable

**Activation threshold:**
- Automatic thresholds: convenient but verify visually
- Manual thresholds: may be needed for non-standard muscles
- Resting baseline: should be near zero (if not, check electrodes)

**Burst characteristics:**
- **Phasic**: Brief bursts (startle, rapid movements)
- **Tonic**: Sustained activation (postural, sustained grip)
- **Rhythmic**: Repeated bursts (tremor, walking)

### Hrv

# Heart Rate Variability (HRV) Analysis

## Overview

Heart Rate Variability (HRV) reflects the variation in time intervals between consecutive heartbeats, providing insights into autonomic nervous system regulation, cardiovascular health, and psychological state. NeuroKit2 provides comprehensive HRV analysis across time, frequency, and nonlinear domains.

## Main Function

### hrv()

Compute all available HRV indices at once across all domains.

```python
hrv_indices = nk.hrv(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, show=False)
```

**Input:**
- `peaks`: Dictionary with `'ECG_R_Peaks'` key or array of R-peak indices
- `sampling_rate`: Signal sampling rate in Hz

**Returns:**
- DataFrame with HRV indices from all domains:
  - Time domain metrics
  - Frequency domain power spectra
  - Nonlinear complexity measures

**This is a convenience wrapper** that combines:
- `hrv_time()`
- `hrv_frequency()`
- `hrv_nonlinear()`

## Time Domain Analysis

  - High-frequency variability, reflects parasympathetic activity
  - More stable with shorter recordings

**Successive difference measures:**
- `HRV_SDSD`: Standard deviation of successive differences (ms)
  - Similar to RMSSD, correlated with parasympathetic activity
- `HRV_pNN50`: Percentage of successive NN intervals differing >50ms
  - Parasympathetic indicator, may be insensitive in some populations

- **Long-term (24 hr)**: Required for SDNN interpretation, captures circadian rhythms

## Frequency Domain Analysis

### hrv_frequency()

Analyze HRV power across frequency bands using spectral analysis.

```python
hrv_freq = nk.hrv_frequency(peaks, sampling_rate=1000, ulf=(0, 0.0033), vlf=(0.0033, 0.04),
                            lf=(0.04, 0.15), hf=(0.15, 0.4), vhf=(0.4, 0.5),
                            psd_method='welch', normalize=True)
```

### Frequency Bands

**Ultra-Low Frequency (ULF): 0-0.0033 Hz**

```python
blink_rate = nk.eog_rate(blinks, sampling_rate=500, desired_length=None)
```

**Method:**
- Calculate inter-blink intervals
- Convert to blinks per minute
- Interpolate to match signal length

**Typical blink rates:**
- **Resting**: 15-20 blinks/min
- **Reading/visual tasks**: 5-10 blinks/min (suppressed)
- **Conversation**: 20-30 blinks/min
- **Stress/dry eyes**: >30 blinks/min
- **Drowsiness**: Variable, longer blinks

## Analysis Functions

### eog_analyze()

Automatically select event-related or interval-related analysis.

```python
analysis = nk.eog_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=500)
```

**Mode selection:**
- Duration < 10 seconds → event-related
- Duration ≥ 10 seconds → interval-related

### eog_eventrelated()

Analyze blink patterns relative to specific events.

```python
results = nk.eog_eventrelated(epochs)
```

**Computed metrics (per epoch):**
- `EOG_Blinks_N`: Number of blinks during epoch
- `EOG_Rate_Mean`: Average blink rate
- `EOG_Blink_Presence`: Binary (any blinks occurred)
- Temporal distribution of blinks across epoch

**Use cases:**
- Blink-locked ERP contamination assessment
- Attention and engagement during stimuli
- Visual task difficulty (suppressed blinks during demanding tasks)
- Spontaneous blinks after stimulus offset

### eog_intervalrelated()

Analyze blink patterns over extended periods.

```python
results = nk.eog_intervalrelated(signals, sampling_rate=500)
```

**Computed metrics:**
- `EOG_Blinks_N`: Total number of blinks
- `EOG_Rate_Mean`: Average blink rate (blinks/min)
- `EOG_Rate_SD`: Blink rate variability
- `EOG_Duration_Mean`: Average blink duration (if available)
- `EOG_Amplitude_Mean`: Average blink amplitude (if available)

**Use cases:**

Visualize processed EOG signal and detected blinks.

```python
nk.eog_plot(signals, info)
```

**Displays:**
- Raw and cleaned EOG signal
- Detected blink markers
- Blink rate time course

## Practical Considerations

### Sampling Rate Recommendations
- **Minimum**: 100 Hz (basic blink detection)
- **Standard**: 250-500 Hz (research applications)
- **High-resolution**: 1000 Hz (detailed waveform analysis, saccades)
- **Sleep studies**: 200-250 Hz typical

### Recording Duration
- **Blink detection**: Any duration (≥1 blink)
- **Blink rate estimation**: ≥60 seconds for stable estimate
- **Event-related**: Depends on paradigm (seconds per trial)
- **Sleep EOG**: Hours (full night)

### Electrode Placement

**Standard configurations:**

**Horizontal EOG (HEOG):**
- Two electrodes: lateral canthi (outer corners) of left and right eyes
- Measures horizontal eye movements (saccades, smooth pursuit)
- Bipolar recording (left - right)

**Vertical EOG (VEOG):**
- Two electrodes: above and below one eye (typically right)
- Measures vertical eye movements and blinks
- Bipolar recording (above - below)

**Sleep EOG:**
- Often uses slightly different placement (temple area)
- E1: 1 cm lateral and 1 cm below outer canthus of left eye
- E2: 1 cm lateral and 1 cm above outer canthus of right eye
- Captures both horizontal and vertical movements

**EEG contamination removal:**
- Frontal electrodes (Fp1, Fp2) can serve as EOG proxies
- ICA-based EOG artifact removal common in EEG preprocessing

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Electrode issues:**
- Poor contact: low amplitude, noise
- Skin preparation: clean, light abrasion
- Conductive gel: ensure good contact

**Artifacts:**
- Muscle activity (especially frontalis): high-frequency noise
- Movement: cable artifacts, head motion
- Electrical noise: 50/60 Hz hum (ground properly)

**Saturation:**
- Large saccades may saturate amplifier
- Adjust gain or voltage range
- More common with low-resolution systems

### Best Practices

**Standard workflow:**
```python
# 1. Clean signal
cleaned = nk.eog_clean(eog_raw, sampling_rate=500, method='neurokit')

# 2. Detect blinks
blinks, info = nk.eog_peaks(cleaned, sampling_rate=500, method='neurokit')

# 3. Extract features
features = nk.eog_features(signals, sampling_rate=500)

# 4. Comprehensive processing (alternative)
signals, info = nk.eog_process(eog_raw, sampling_rate=500)

# 5. Analyze
analysis = nk.eog_analyze(signals, sampling_rate=500)
```

**EEG artifact correction workflow:**
```python
# Option 1: Regression-based removal
# Identify EOG components from cleaned EOG signal
# Regress out EOG from EEG channels

# Option 2: ICA-based removal (preferred)
# 1. Run ICA on EEG data including EOG channels
# 2. Identify ICA components correlated with EOG
# 3. Remove EOG components from EEG data
# NeuroKit2 integrates with MNE for this workflow
```

## Clinical and Research Applications

**EEG artifact correction:**
- Blinks contaminate frontal EEG channels
- ICA or regression methods remove EOG artifacts
- Essential for ERP studies

**Sleep staging:**
- Rapid eye movements (REMs) during REM sleep
- Slow rolling eye movements during drowsiness
- Sleep onset and stage transitions

**Attention and cognitive load:**
- Blink rate suppressed during demanding tasks
- Blinks cluster at task boundaries (natural breakpoints)
- Spontaneous blink as indicator of attention shifts

**Fatigue and drowsiness monitoring:**
- Increased blink duration when sleepy
- Slower eyelid closures
- Partial or incomplete blinks
- Driver monitoring applications

**Reading and visual processing:**
- Blinks suppressed during reading
- Eye movements during saccades (line changes)
- Fatigue effects on reading efficiency

**Neurological disorders:**
- **Parkinson's disease**: Reduced spontaneous blink rate
- **Schizophrenia**: Increased blink rate
- **Tourette syndrome**: Excessive blinking (tics)
- **Dry eye syndrome**: Increased, incomplete blinks

**Affective and social cognition:**
- Blink synchrony in social interaction
- Emotional modulation of blink rate
- Blink-related potentials in ERPs

**Human-computer interaction:**
- Gaze tracking preprocessing
- Attention monitoring
- User engagement assessment

## Eye Movement Types Detectable with EOG

**Blinks:**
- Large amplitude, brief duration (100-400 ms)
- NeuroKit2 primary focus
- Vertical EOG most sensitive

**Saccades:**
- Rapid, ballistic eye movements (20-80 ms)
- Step-like voltage deflections
- Horizontal or vertical
- Require higher sampling rates for detailed analysis

**Smooth pursuit:**
- Slow tracking of moving objects
- Ramp-like voltage changes
- Lower amplitude than saccades

**Fixations:**
- Stable gaze
- Baseline EOG with small oscillations
- Duration varies (200-600 ms typical in reading)

**Note:** Detailed saccade/fixation analysis typically requires eye tracking (infrared, video-based). EOG useful for blinks and gross eye movements.

## Interpretation Guidelines

**Blink rate:**
- **Normal resting**: 15-20 blinks/min
- **<10 blinks/min**: Visual task engagement, concentration
- **>30 blinks/min**: Stress, dry eyes, fatigue
- **Context-dependent**: Task demands, lighting, screen use

**Blink duration:**
- **Normal**: 100-400 ms (mean ~200 ms)
- **Prolonged**: Drowsiness, fatigue (>500 ms)
- **Short**: Normal alertness

**Blink amplitude:**
- Varies with electrode placement and individuals
- Within-subject comparisons most reliable
- Incomplete blinks: reduced amplitude (dry eye, fatigue)

**Temporal patterns:**
- **Clustered blinks**: Transitions between tasks or cognitive states
- **Suppressed blinks**: Active visual processing, sustained attention
- **Post-stimulus blinks**: After completing visual processing
