> Comprehensive toolkit for protein language models including ESM3 (generative multimodal protein design across sequence, structure, and function) and ESM C (efficient protein embeddings and representations). Use this skill when working with protein sequences, structures, or function prediction; designing novel proteins; generating protein embeddings; performing inverse folding; or conducting protein engineering tasks. Supports both local model usage and cloud-based Forge API for scalable inference.

# ESM: Evolutionary Scale Modeling

## Overview

ESM provides state-of-the-art protein language models for understanding, generating, and designing proteins. This skill enables working with two model families: ESM3 for generative protein design across sequence, structure, and function, and ESM C for efficient protein representation learning and embeddings.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Protein Sequence Generation with ESM3

Generate novel protein sequences with desired properties using multimodal generative modeling.

**When to use:**
- Designing proteins with specific functional properties
- Completing partial protein sequences
- Generating variants of existing proteins
- Creating proteins with desired structural characteristics

**Basic usage:**

```python
from esm.models.esm3 import ESM3
from esm.sdk.api import ESM3InferenceClient, ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

# Load model locally
model: ESM3InferenceClient = ESM3.from_pretrained("esm3-sm-open-v1").to("cuda")

# Create protein prompt
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRT___KEND")  # '_' represents masked positions

# Generate completion
protein = model.generate(protein, GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=8))
print(protein.sequence)
```

**For remote/cloud usage via Forge API:**

```python
from esm.sdk.forge import ESM3ForgeInferenceClient
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

# Connect to Forge
model = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(model="esm3-medium-2024-08", url="https://forge.evolutionaryscale.ai", token="<token>")

# Generate
protein = model.generate(protein, GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=8))
```

See `references/esm3-api.md` for detailed ESM3 model specifications, advanced generation configurations, and multimodal prompting examples.

### 2. Structure Prediction and Inverse Folding

Use ESM3's structure track for structure prediction from sequence or inverse folding (sequence design from structure).

**Structure prediction:**

```python
from esm.sdk.api import ESM3InferenceClient, ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

# Predict structure from sequence
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP...")
protein_with_structure = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="structure", num_steps=protein.sequence.count("_"))
)

# Access predicted structure
coordinates = protein_with_structure.coordinates  # 3D coordinates
pdb_string = protein_with_structure.to_pdb()
```

**Inverse folding (sequence from structure):**

```python
# Design sequence for a target structure
protein_with_structure = ESMProtein.from_pdb("target_structure.pdb")
protein_with_structure.sequence = None  # Remove sequence

# Generate sequence that folds to this structure
designed_protein = model.generate(
    protein_with_structure,
    GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=50, temperature=0.7)
)
```

### 3. Protein Embeddings with ESM C

Generate high-quality embeddings for downstream tasks like function prediction, classification, or similarity analysis.

**When to use:**
- Extracting protein representations for machine learning
- Computing sequence similarities
- Feature extraction for protein classification
- Transfer learning for protein-related tasks

**Basic usage:**

```python
from esm.models.esmc import ESMC
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein

# Load ESM C model
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-300m").to("cuda")

# Get embeddings
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP...")
protein_tensor = model.encode(protein)

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = model.forward(protein_tensor)
```

**Batch processing:**

```python
# Encode multiple proteins
proteins = [
    ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTKEIND..."),
    ESMProtein(sequence="AGLIVHSPQ..."),
    ESMProtein(sequence="KTEFLNDGR...")
]

embeddings_list = [model.logits(model.forward(model.encode(p))) for p in proteins]
```

See `references/esm-c-api.md` for ESM C model details, efficiency comparisons, and advanced embedding strategies.

### 4. Function Conditioning and Annotation

Use ESM3's function track to generate proteins with specific functional annotations or predict function from sequence.

**Function-conditioned generation:**

```python
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, FunctionAnnotation, GenerationConfig

# Create protein with desired function
protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="_" * 200,  # Generate 200 residue protein
    function_annotations=[
        FunctionAnnotation(label="fluorescent_protein", start=50, end=150)
    ]
)

# Generate sequence with specified function
functional_protein = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=200)
)
```

### 5. Chain-of-Thought Generation

Iteratively refine protein designs using ESM3's chain-of-thought generation approach.

```python
from esm.sdk.api import GenerationConfig

# Multi-step refinement
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRT" + "_" * 100 + "KEND")

# Step 1: Generate initial structure
config = GenerationConfig(track="structure", num_steps=50)
protein = model.generate(protein, config)

# Step 2: Refine sequence based on structure
config = GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=50, temperature=0.5)
protein = model.generate(protein, config)

# Step 3: Predict function
config = GenerationConfig(track="function", num_steps=20)
protein = model.generate(protein, config)
```

### 6. Batch Processing with Forge API

Process multiple proteins efficiently using Forge's async executor.

```python
from esm.sdk.forge import ESM3ForgeInferenceClient
import asyncio

client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(model="esm3-medium-2024-08", token="<token>")

# Async batch processing
async def batch_generate(proteins_list):
    tasks = [
        client.async_generate(protein, GenerationConfig(track="sequence"))
        for protein in proteins_list
    ]
    return await asyncio.gather(*tasks)

# Execute
proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=f"MPRT{'_' * 50}KEND") for _ in range(10)]
results = asyncio.run(batch_generate(proteins))
```

See `references/forge-api.md` for detailed Forge API documentation, authentication, rate limits, and batch processing patterns.

- `esmc-300m` (30 layers) - Lightweight, fast inference
- `esmc-600m` (36 layers) - Balanced performance
- `esmc-6b` (80 layers) - Maximum representation quality

**Selection criteria:**
- **Local development/testing:** Use `esm3-sm-open-v1` or `esmc-300m`
- **Production quality:** Use `esm3-medium-2024-08` via Forge
- **Maximum accuracy:** Use `esm3-large-2024-03` or `esmc-6b`
- **High throughput:** Use Forge API with batch executor
- **Cost optimization:** Use smaller models, implement caching strategies

## Installation

**Basic installation:**

```bash
uv pip install esm
```

**With Flash Attention (recommended for faster inference):**

```bash
uv pip install esm
uv pip install flash-attn --no-build-isolation
```

- Reduced memory footprint

## Core API Components

### ESMC Class

Main interface for ESM C models.

**Model Loading:**

```python
from esm.models.esmc import ESMC
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein

# Load model with automatic device placement
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-300m").to("cuda")

# Or specify device explicitly
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-600m").to("cpu")

# For maximum quality
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-6b").to("cuda")
```

**Model Selection Criteria:**

- **esmc-300m**: Development, real-time applications, batch processing of many sequences
- **esmc-600m**: Production deployments, good quality/speed balance
- **esmc-6b**: Research, maximum accuracy for downstream tasks

### Basic Embedding Generation

**Single Sequence:**

```python
from esm.models.esmc import ESMC
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein

# Load model
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-600m").to("cuda")

# Create protein
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSPQWFYK")

# Encode to tensor
protein_tensor = model.encode(protein)

# Generate embeddings
embeddings = model.forward(protein_tensor)

# Get logits (per-position predictions)
logits = model.logits(embeddings)

print(f"Embedding shape: {embeddings.shape}")
print(f"Logits shape: {logits.shape}")
```

**Output Shapes:**

For a sequence of length L:
- `embeddings.shape`: `(1, L, hidden_dim)` where hidden_dim depends on model
  - esmc-300m: hidden_dim = 960
  - esmc-600m: hidden_dim = 1152
  - esmc-6b: hidden_dim = 2560
- `logits.shape`: `(1, L, 64)` - per-position amino acid predictions

### Batch Processing

Process multiple sequences efficiently:

```python
import torch

# Multiple proteins
sequences = [
    "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP",
    "AGKWFYLTQSNHERVPM",
    "DEIFKRNAVWGSLTPQY"
]

proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=seq) for seq in sequences]

# Encode all
protein_tensors = [model.encode(p) for p in proteins]

# Process batch (if same length)
# For variable lengths, process individually or pad
embeddings_list = []
for tensor in protein_tensors:
    embedding = model.forward(tensor)
    embeddings_list.append(embedding)

print(f"Processed {len(embeddings_list)} proteins")
```

**Efficient Batching for Variable Lengths:**

```python
def batch_encode_variable_length(model, sequences, max_batch_size=32):
    """
    Efficiently batch encode sequences of variable length.
    Groups by similar length for efficiency.
    """
    # Sort by length
    sorted_seqs = sorted(enumerate(sequences), key=lambda x: len(x[1]))

    results = [None] * len(sequences)
    batch = []
    batch_indices = []

    for idx, seq in sorted_seqs:
        batch.append(seq)
        batch_indices.append(idx)

        # Process batch when full or length changes significantly
        if (len(batch) >= max_batch_size or
            (len(batch) > 0 and abs(len(seq) - len(batch[0])) > 10)):

            # Process current batch
            proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=s) for s in batch]
            embeddings = [model.forward(model.encode(p)) for p in proteins]

            # Store results
            for i, emb in zip(batch_indices, embeddings):
                results[i] = emb

            batch = []
            batch_indices = []

    # Process remaining
    if batch:
        proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=s) for s in batch]
        embeddings = [model.forward(model.encode(p)) for p in proteins]
        for i, emb in zip(batch_indices, embeddings):
            results[i] = emb

    return results
```

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Sequence Similarity Analysis

Compute similarity between proteins using embeddings:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn.functional as F

def get_sequence_embedding(model, sequence):
    """Get mean-pooled sequence embedding."""
    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=sequence)
    tensor = model.encode(protein)
    embedding = model.forward(tensor)

    # Mean pooling over sequence length
    return embedding.mean(dim=1)

# Get embeddings
seq1_emb = get_sequence_embedding(model, "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP")
seq2_emb = get_sequence_embedding(model, "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSQ")  # Similar
seq3_emb = get_sequence_embedding(model, "WWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW")  # Different

# Compute cosine similarity
sim_1_2 = F.cosine_similarity(seq1_emb, seq2_emb)
sim_1_3 = F.cosine_similarity(seq1_emb, seq3_emb)

print(f"Similarity (1,2): {sim_1_2.item():.4f}")
print(f"Similarity (1,3): {sim_1_3.item():.4f}")
```

### 2. Protein Classification

Use embeddings as features for classification:

```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Generate embeddings for training set
def embed_dataset(model, sequences):
    embeddings = []
    for seq in sequences:
        protein = ESMProtein(sequence=seq)
        tensor = model.encode(protein)
        emb = model.forward(tensor).mean(dim=1)  # Mean pooling
        embeddings.append(emb.cpu().detach().numpy().flatten())
    return np.array(embeddings)

# Example: Classify proteins by function
train_sequences = [...]  # Your sequences
train_labels = [...]      # Your labels

embeddings = embed_dataset(model, train_sequences)

# Train classifier
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(
    embeddings, train_labels, test_size=0.2
)

classifier = LogisticRegression(max_iter=1000)
classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Evaluate
accuracy = classifier.score(X_test, y_test)
print(f"Classification accuracy: {accuracy:.4f}")
```

### 3. Protein Clustering

Cluster proteins based on sequence similarity:

```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
import numpy as np

# Generate embeddings
sequences = [...]  # Your protein sequences
embeddings = embed_dataset(model, sequences)

# Cluster
n_clusters = 5
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=n_clusters, random_state=42)
cluster_labels = kmeans.fit_predict(embeddings)

# Analyze clusters
for i in range(n_clusters):
    cluster_seqs = [seq for seq, label in zip(sequences, cluster_labels) if label == i]
    print(f"Cluster {i}: {len(cluster_seqs)} sequences")
```

### 4. Sequence Search and Retrieval

Find similar sequences in a database:

```python
import torch
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity

def build_sequence_index(model, database_sequences):
    """Build searchable index of sequence embeddings."""
    embeddings = []
    for seq in database_sequences:
        emb = get_sequence_embedding(model, seq)
        embeddings.append(emb.cpu().detach().numpy().flatten())
    return np.array(embeddings)

def search_similar_sequences(model, query_seq, database_embeddings,
                            database_sequences, top_k=10):
    """Find top-k most similar sequences."""
    query_emb = get_sequence_embedding(model, query_seq)
    query_emb_np = query_emb.cpu().detach().numpy().flatten().reshape(1, -1)

    # Compute similarities
    similarities = cosine_similarity(query_emb_np, database_embeddings)[0]

    # Get top-k
    top_indices = np.argsort(similarities)[-top_k:][::-1]

    results = [
        (database_sequences[idx], similarities[idx])
        for idx in top_indices
    ]
    return results

# Example usage
database_seqs = [...]  # Large sequence database
index = build_sequence_index(model, database_seqs)

query = "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP"
similar = search_similar_sequences(model, query, index, database_seqs, top_k=5)

for seq, score in similar:
    print(f"Score: {score:.4f} - {seq[:30]}...")
```

### 5. Feature Extraction for Downstream Models

Use ESM C embeddings as input to custom neural networks:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class ProteinPropertyPredictor(nn.Module):
    """Example: Predict protein properties from ESM C embeddings."""

    def __init__(self, embedding_dim, hidden_dim, output_dim):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, hidden_dim)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(hidden_dim, output_dim)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.dropout = nn.Dropout(0.3)

    def forward(self, embeddings):
        # embeddings: (batch, seq_len, embedding_dim)
        # Mean pool over sequence
        x = embeddings.mean(dim=1)

        x = self.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.dropout(x)
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

# Use ESM C as frozen feature extractor
esm_model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-600m").to("cuda")
esm_model.eval()  # Freeze

# Create task-specific model
predictor = ProteinPropertyPredictor(
    embedding_dim=1152,  # esmc-600m dimension
    hidden_dim=512,
    output_dim=1  # e.g., stability score
).to("cuda")

# Training loop
for sequence, target in dataloader:
    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=sequence)
    with torch.no_grad():
        embeddings = esm_model.forward(esm_model.encode(protein))

    prediction = predictor(embeddings)
    loss = criterion(prediction, target)
    # ... backprop through predictor only
```

### 6. Per-Residue Analysis

Extract per-residue representations for detailed analysis:

```python
def get_per_residue_embeddings(model, sequence):
    """Get embedding for each residue."""
    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=sequence)
    tensor = model.encode(protein)
    embeddings = model.forward(tensor)

    # embeddings shape: (1, seq_len, hidden_dim)
    return embeddings.squeeze(0)  # (seq_len, hidden_dim)

# Analyze specific positions
sequence = "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSPQWFYK"
residue_embeddings = get_per_residue_embeddings(model, sequence)

# Extract features for position 10
position_10_features = residue_embeddings[10]
print(f"Features for residue {sequence[10]} at position 10:")
print(f"Shape: {position_10_features.shape}")

# Compare residue representations
pos_5 = residue_embeddings[5]
pos_15 = residue_embeddings[15]
similarity = F.cosine_similarity(pos_5, pos_15, dim=0)
print(f"Residue similarity: {similarity.item():.4f}")
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management

```python
import torch

# Use half precision for memory efficiency
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-600m").to("cuda").half()

# Process with mixed precision
with torch.cuda.amp.autocast():
    embeddings = model.forward(model.encode(protein))

# Clear cache between batches
torch.cuda.empty_cache()
```

### Batch Processing Best Practices

```python
def efficient_batch_processing(model, sequences, batch_size=32):
    """Process sequences in optimized batches."""
    results = []

    for i in range(0, len(sequences), batch_size):
        batch = sequences[i:i + batch_size]

        # Process batch
        batch_embeddings = []
        for seq in batch:
            protein = ESMProtein(sequence=seq)
            emb = model.forward(model.encode(protein))
            batch_embeddings.append(emb)

        results.extend(batch_embeddings)

        # Periodically clear cache
        if i % (batch_size * 10) == 0:
            torch.cuda.empty_cache()

    return results
```

### Caching Embeddings

```python
import pickle
import hashlib

def get_cache_key(sequence):
    """Generate cache key for sequence."""
    return hashlib.md5(sequence.encode()).hexdigest()

class EmbeddingCache:
    """Cache for protein embeddings."""

    def __init__(self, cache_file="embeddings_cache.pkl"):
        self.cache_file = cache_file
        try:
            with open(cache_file, 'rb') as f:
                self.cache = pickle.load(f)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            self.cache = {}

    def get(self, sequence):
        key = get_cache_key(sequence)
        return self.cache.get(key)

    def set(self, sequence, embedding):
        key = get_cache_key(sequence)
        self.cache[key] = embedding

    def save(self):
        with open(self.cache_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(self.cache, f)

# Usage
cache = EmbeddingCache()

def get_embedding_cached(model, sequence):
    cached = cache.get(sequence)
    if cached is not None:
        return cached

    # Compute
    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=sequence)
    embedding = model.forward(model.encode(protein))
    cache.set(sequence, embedding)

    return embedding

# Don't forget to save cache
cache.save()
```

## Comparison with ESM2

**Performance Improvements:**

| Metric | ESM2-650M | ESM C-600M | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|------------|-------------|

**Migration from ESM2:**

ESM C is designed as a drop-in replacement:

```python
# Old ESM2 code
from esm import pretrained
model, alphabet = pretrained.esm2_t33_650M_UR50D()

# New ESM C code (similar API)
from esm.models.esmc import ESMC
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-600m")
```

Key differences:
- Faster inference with same or better quality
- Simplified API through ESMProtein
- Better support for long sequences
- More efficient memory usage

## Advanced Topics

### Fine-tuning ESM C

ESM C can be fine-tuned for specific tasks:

```python
import torch.optim as optim

# Load model
model = ESMC.from_pretrained("esmc-300m").to("cuda")

# Unfreeze for fine-tuning
for param in model.parameters():
    param.requires_grad = True

# Define optimizer
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=1e-5)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for sequences, labels in dataloader:
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=seq) for seq in sequences]
        embeddings = [model.forward(model.encode(p)) for p in proteins]

        # Your task-specific loss
        loss = compute_loss(embeddings, labels)

        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()
```

### Attention Visualization

Extract attention weights for interpretability:

```python
def get_attention_weights(model, sequence):
    """Extract attention weights from model."""
    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=sequence)
    tensor = model.encode(protein)

    # Forward with attention output
    output = model.forward(tensor, output_attentions=True)

    return output.attentions  # List of attention tensors per layer

# Visualize attention
attentions = get_attention_weights(model, "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP")
# Process and visualize attention patterns
```

### Workflows

# ESM Workflows and Examples

## Overview

This document provides complete, end-to-end examples of common workflows using ESM3 and ESM C. Each workflow includes setup, execution, and analysis code.

## Workflow 1: Novel GFP Design with Chain-of-Thought

Design a novel fluorescent protein using ESM3's multimodal generation capabilities.

### Objective

Generate a green fluorescent protein (GFP) with specific properties using chain-of-thought reasoning across sequence, structure, and function.

### Complete Implementation

```python
from esm.models.esm3 import ESM3
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, GenerationConfig, FunctionAnnotation
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Setup
model = ESM3.from_pretrained("esm3-sm-open-v1").to("cuda")

# Step 1: Define target properties
print("Step 1: Defining target GFP properties...")

# Create protein with desired function
target_length = 238  # Typical GFP length
protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="_" * target_length,
    function_annotations=[
        FunctionAnnotation(
            label="green_fluorescent_protein",
            start=65,
            end=75  # Chromophore region
        )
    ]
)

# Step 2: Generate initial sequence with function conditioning
print("Step 2: Generating initial sequence...")

config = GenerationConfig(
    track="sequence",
    num_steps=target_length // 3,  # Gradual generation
    temperature=0.7  # Moderate diversity
)
protein = model.generate(protein, config)
print(f"Generated sequence: {protein.sequence[:50]}...")

# Step 3: Predict structure
print("Step 3: Predicting structure...")

config = GenerationConfig(
    track="structure",
    num_steps=target_length // 2
)
protein = model.generate(protein, config)
print(f"Structure predicted, coordinates shape: {protein.coordinates.shape}")

# Step 4: Refine sequence based on structure
print("Step 4: Refining sequence based on structure...")

# Mask regions for refinement (e.g., surface residues)
sequence_list = list(protein.sequence)
# Keep chromophore region, refine others
for i in range(0, 65):
    if i % 3 == 0:  # Refine every third position
        sequence_list[i] = '_'
for i in range(75, target_length):

config = GenerationConfig(
    track="sequence",
    num_steps=50,
    temperature=0.5  # Lower temperature for refinement
)

print(f"\nFinal GFP sequence:\n{protein.sequence}")
print(f"\nFunction annotations: {protein.function_annotations}")
print(f"Structure saved to: novel_gfp.pdb")
```

### Validation Steps

```python
# Analyze designed GFP
def analyze_gfp(protein):
    """Analyze generated GFP properties."""

    # Check chromophore region (should be around Ser65-Tyr66-Gly67)
    chromophore_region = protein.sequence[64:68]

        beta_content = protein.secondary_structure.count('E') / len(protein.sequence)
        print(f"Beta sheet content: {beta_content:.2%}")

    # Check sequence similarity to known GFPs
    # (Would require BLAST or alignment tool in practice)

## Additional Workflow Tips

### Memory Management for Large Datasets

```python
def process_large_dataset(sequences, batch_size=32):
    """Process large dataset with memory management."""
    import gc
    import torch

    results = []

    for i in range(0, len(sequences), batch_size):
        batch = sequences[i:i + batch_size]

        # Process batch
        batch_results = [process_sequence(seq) for seq in batch]
        results.extend(batch_results)

        # Clear memory
        torch.cuda.empty_cache()
        gc.collect()

        if (i + batch_size) % 100 == 0:
            print(f"Processed {min(i + batch_size, len(sequences))}/{len(sequences)}")

    return results
```

### Parallel Processing

```python
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor
import asyncio

def parallel_workflow(sequences, n_workers=4):
    """Process sequences in parallel."""

    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=n_workers) as executor:
        results = list(executor.map(process_sequence, sequences))

    return results
```

These workflows provide comprehensive examples for common ESM use cases. Adapt them to your specific needs and always validate results with appropriate biological experiments.

## ESM3ForgeInferenceClient API

### Initialization

```python
from esm.sdk.forge import ESM3ForgeInferenceClient

# Basic initialization
client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(
    model="esm3-medium-2024-08",
    token="<your-token>"
)

# With custom URL (for enterprise deployments)
client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(
    model="esm3-medium-2024-08",
    url="https://custom.forge.instance.com",
    token="<your-token>"
)

# With timeout configuration
client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(
    model="esm3-medium-2024-08",
    token="<your-token>",
    timeout=300  # 5 minutes
)
```

### Synchronous Generation

Standard blocking generation calls:

```python
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

# Basic generation
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRT___KEND")
config = GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=8)

result = client.generate(protein, config)
print(f"Generated: {result.sequence}")
```

### Asynchronous Generation

For concurrent processing of multiple proteins:

```python
import asyncio
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

async def generate_many(client, proteins):
    """Generate multiple proteins concurrently."""
    tasks = []

    for protein in proteins:
        task = client.async_generate(
            protein,
            GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=8)
        )
        tasks.append(task)

    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    return results

# Usage
proteins = [
    ESMProtein(sequence=f"MPRT{'_' * 10}KEND"),
    ESMProtein(sequence=f"AGLV{'_' * 10}HSPQ"),
    ESMProtein(sequence=f"KEIT{'_' * 10}NDFL")
]

results = asyncio.run(generate_many(client, proteins))
print(f"Generated {len(results)} proteins")
```

### Batch Processing with BatchExecutor

For large-scale processing with automatic concurrency management:

```python
from esm.sdk.forge import BatchExecutor
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein, GenerationConfig

# Create batch executor
executor = BatchExecutor(
    client=client,
    max_concurrent=10  # Process 10 requests concurrently
)

# Prepare batch of proteins
proteins = [ESMProtein(sequence=f"MPRT{'_' * 50}KEND") for _ in range(100)]
config = GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=25)

# Submit batch
batch_results = executor.submit_batch(
    proteins=proteins,
    config=config,
    progress_callback=lambda i, total: print(f"Processed {i}/{total}")
)

print(f"Completed {len(batch_results)} generations")
```

## Rate Limiting and Quotas

### Understanding Limits

Forge implements rate limiting based on:
- Requests per minute (RPM)
- Tokens per minute (TPM)
- Concurrent requests

**Typical Limits (subject to change):**
- Free tier: 60 RPM, 5 concurrent
- Pro tier: 300 RPM, 20 concurrent
- Enterprise: Custom limits

### Handling Rate Limits

```python
import time
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError

def generate_with_retry(client, protein, config, max_retries=3):
    """Generate with automatic retry on rate limit."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return client.generate(protein, config)
        except HTTPError as e:
            if e.response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limit
                wait_time = 2 ** attempt  # Exponential backoff
                print(f"Rate limited, waiting {wait_time}s...")
                time.sleep(wait_time)
            else:
                raise
    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")

# Usage
result = generate_with_retry(client, protein, config)
```

### Implementing Custom Rate Limiter

```python
import time
from collections import deque

class RateLimiter:
    """Simple rate limiter for API calls."""

    def __init__(self, max_per_minute=60):
        self.max_per_minute = max_per_minute
        self.calls = deque()

    def wait_if_needed(self):
        """Wait if rate limit would be exceeded."""
        now = time.time()

        # Remove old calls
        while self.calls and self.calls[0] < now - 60:
            self.calls.popleft()

        # Wait if at limit
        if len(self.calls) >= self.max_per_minute:
            sleep_time = 60 - (now - self.calls[0])
            if sleep_time > 0:
                time.sleep(sleep_time)
            self.calls.popleft()

        self.calls.append(now)

# Usage
limiter = RateLimiter(max_per_minute=60)

for protein in proteins:
    limiter.wait_if_needed()
    result = client.generate(protein, config)
```

## Advanced Patterns

### Streaming Results

Process results as they complete:

```python
import asyncio
from concurrent.futures import ThreadPoolExecutor

async def stream_generate(client, proteins, config):
    """Stream results as they complete."""
    pending = {
        asyncio.create_task(client.async_generate(p, config)): i
        for i, p in enumerate(proteins)
    }

    results = [None] * len(proteins)

    while pending:
        done, pending = await asyncio.wait(
            pending.keys(),
            return_when=asyncio.FIRST_COMPLETED
        )

        for task in done:
            idx = pending.pop(task)
            result = await task
            results[idx] = result
            yield idx, result

# Usage
async def process_stream():
    async for idx, result in stream_generate(client, proteins, config):
        print(f"Completed protein {idx}: {result.sequence[:20]}...")

asyncio.run(process_stream())
```

### Batch with Progress Tracking

```python
from tqdm import tqdm
import asyncio

async def batch_with_progress(client, proteins, config):
    """Process batch with progress bar."""
    results = []

    with tqdm(total=len(proteins)) as pbar:
        for protein in proteins:
            result = await client.async_generate(protein, config)
            results.append(result)
            pbar.update(1)

    return results

# Usage
results = asyncio.run(batch_with_progress(client, proteins, config))
```

### Checkpoint and Resume

For long-running batch jobs:

```python
import pickle
import os

class CheckpointedBatchProcessor:
    """Batch processor with checkpoint/resume capability."""

    def __init__(self, client, checkpoint_file="checkpoint.pkl"):
        self.client = client
        self.checkpoint_file = checkpoint_file
        self.completed = self.load_checkpoint()

    def load_checkpoint(self):
        if os.path.exists(self.checkpoint_file):
            with open(self.checkpoint_file, 'rb') as f:
                return pickle.load(f)
        return {}

    def save_checkpoint(self):
        with open(self.checkpoint_file, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(self.completed, f)

    def process_batch(self, proteins, config):
        """Process batch with checkpointing."""
        results = {}

        for i, protein in enumerate(proteins):
            # Skip if already completed
            if i in self.completed:
                results[i] = self.completed[i]
                continue

            try:
                result = self.client.generate(protein, config)
                results[i] = result
                self.completed[i] = result

                # Save checkpoint every 10 items
                if i % 10 == 0:
                    self.save_checkpoint()

            except Exception as e:
                print(f"Error processing {i}: {e}")
                self.save_checkpoint()
                raise

        self.save_checkpoint()
        return results

# Usage
processor = CheckpointedBatchProcessor(client)
results = processor.process_batch(proteins, config)
```

## Error Handling

### Common Errors and Solutions

```python
from requests.exceptions import HTTPError, ConnectionError, Timeout

def robust_generate(client, protein, config):
    """Generate with comprehensive error handling."""
    try:
        return client.generate(protein, config)

    except HTTPError as e:
        if e.response.status_code == 401:
            raise ValueError("Invalid API token")
        elif e.response.status_code == 429:
            raise ValueError("Rate limit exceeded - slow down requests")
        elif e.response.status_code == 500:
            raise ValueError("Server error - try again later")
        else:
            raise

    except ConnectionError:
        raise ValueError("Network error - check internet connection")

    except Timeout:
        raise ValueError("Request timeout - try smaller protein or increase timeout")

    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}")

# Usage with retry logic
def generate_with_full_retry(client, protein, config, max_retries=3):
    """Combine error handling with retry logic."""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return robust_generate(client, protein, config)
        except ValueError as e:
            if "rate limit" in str(e).lower() and attempt < max_retries - 1:
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
                continue
            raise
```

## Cost Optimization

### Strategies to Reduce Costs

**1. Use Appropriate Model Size:**

```python
# Use smaller model for testing
dev_client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(
    model="esm3-small-2024-08",
    token=token
)

# Use larger model only for final generation
prod_client = ESM3ForgeInferenceClient(
    model="esm3-large-2024-03",
    token=token
)
```

**2. Cache Results:**

```python
import hashlib
import json

class ForgeCache:
    """Cache Forge API results locally."""

    def __init__(self, cache_dir="forge_cache"):
        self.cache_dir = cache_dir
        os.makedirs(cache_dir, exist_ok=True)

    def get_cache_key(self, protein, config):
        """Generate cache key from inputs."""
        data = {
            'sequence': protein.sequence,
            'config': str(config)
        }
        return hashlib.md5(json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True).encode()).hexdigest()

    def get(self, protein, config):
        """Get cached result."""
        key = self.get_cache_key(protein, config)
        path = os.path.join(self.cache_dir, f"{key}.pkl")

        if os.path.exists(path):
            with open(path, 'rb') as f:
                return pickle.load(f)
        return None

    def set(self, protein, config, result):
        """Cache result."""
        key = self.get_cache_key(protein, config)
        path = os.path.join(self.cache_dir, f"{key}.pkl")

        with open(path, 'wb') as f:
            pickle.dump(result, f)

# Usage
cache = ForgeCache()

def cached_generate(client, protein, config):
    """Generate with caching."""
    cached = cache.get(protein, config)
    if cached:
        return cached

    result = client.generate(protein, config)
    cache.set(protein, config, result)
    return result
```

**3. Batch Similar Requests:**

Group similar generation tasks to reduce overhead:

```python
def batch_similar_tasks(proteins, max_batch_size=50):
    """Group proteins by similar properties."""
    # Sort by length for efficient processing
    sorted_proteins = sorted(proteins, key=lambda p: len(p.sequence))

    batches = []
    current_batch = []

    for protein in sorted_proteins:
        current_batch.append(protein)

        if len(current_batch) >= max_batch_size:
            batches.append(current_batch)
            current_batch = []

    if current_batch:
        batches.append(current_batch)

    return batches
```

## Monitoring and Logging

### Track API Usage

```python
import logging
from datetime import datetime

class ForgeMonitor:
    """Monitor Forge API usage."""

    def __init__(self):
        self.calls = []
        self.errors = []

    def log_call(self, model, protein_length, duration, success=True, error=None):
        """Log API call."""
        entry = {
            'timestamp': datetime.now(),
            'model': model,
            'protein_length': protein_length,
            'duration': duration,
            'success': success,
            'error': str(error) if error else None
        }

        if success:
            self.calls.append(entry)
        else:
            self.errors.append(entry)

    def get_stats(self):
        """Get usage statistics."""
        total_calls = len(self.calls) + len(self.errors)
        success_rate = len(self.calls) / total_calls if total_calls > 0 else 0
        avg_duration = sum(c['duration'] for c in self.calls) / len(self.calls) if self.calls else 0

        return {
            'total_calls': total_calls,
            'successful': len(self.calls),
            'failed': len(self.errors),
            'success_rate': success_rate,
            'avg_duration': avg_duration
        }

# Usage
monitor = ForgeMonitor()

def monitored_generate(client, protein, config):
    """Generate with monitoring."""
    start = time.time()

    try:
        result = client.generate(protein, config)
        duration = time.time() - start
        monitor.log_call(
            model=client.model,
            protein_length=len(protein.sequence),
            duration=duration,
            success=True
        )
        return result

    except Exception as e:
        duration = time.time() - start
        monitor.log_call(
            model=client.model,
            protein_length=len(protein.sequence),
            duration=duration,
            success=False,
            error=e
        )
        raise

# Check stats
print(monitor.get_stats())
```

### Esm3 Api

# ESM3 API Reference

## Overview

ESM3 is a frontier multimodal generative language model that reasons over the sequence, structure, and function of proteins. It uses iterative masked language modeling to simultaneously generate across these three modalities.

## Model Architecture

**ESM3 Family Models:**

| Model ID | Parameters | Availability | Best For |
|----------|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `esm3-sm-open-v1` | 1.4B | Open weights (local) | Development, testing, learning |
| `esm3-medium-2024-08` | 7B | Forge API only | Production, balanced quality/speed |
| `esm3-large-2024-03` | 98B | Forge API only | Maximum quality, research |
| `esm3-medium-multimer-2024-09` | 7B | Forge API only | Protein complexes (experimental) |

**Key Features:**
- Simultaneous reasoning across sequence, structure, and function
- Iterative generation with controllable number of steps
- Support for partial prompting across modalities
- Chain-of-thought generation for complex designs
- Temperature control for generation diversity

## Core API Components

### ESMProtein Class

The central data structure representing a protein with optional sequence, structure, and function information.

**Constructor:**

```python
from esm.sdk.api import ESMProtein

protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSP",           # Amino acid sequence (optional)
    coordinates=coordinates_array,          # 3D structure (optional)
    function_annotations=[...],             # Function labels (optional)
    secondary_structure="HHHEEEECCC",       # SS annotations (optional)
    sasa=sasa_array                        # Solvent accessibility (optional)
)
```

**Key Methods:**

```python
# Load from PDB file
protein = ESMProtein.from_pdb("protein.pdb")

# Export to PDB format
pdb_string = protein.to_pdb()

# Save to file
with open("output.pdb", "w") as f:
    f.write(protein.to_pdb())
```

**Masking Conventions:**

Use `_` (underscore) to represent masked positions for generation:

```python
# Mask positions 5-10 for generation
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRT______AGLIVHSP")

# Fully masked sequence (generate from scratch)
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="_" * 200)

# Partial structure (some coordinates None)
protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="MPRTKEIND",
    coordinates=partial_coords  # Some positions can be None
)
```

### GenerationConfig Class

Controls generation behavior and parameters.

**Basic Configuration:**

```python
from esm.sdk.api import GenerationConfig

config = GenerationConfig(
    track="sequence",              # Track to generate: "sequence", "structure", or "function"
    num_steps=8,                  # Number of demasking steps
    temperature=0.7,              # Sampling temperature (0.0-1.0)
    top_p=None,                   # Nucleus sampling threshold
    condition_on_coordinates_only=False  # For structure conditioning
)
```

**Parameter Details:**

- **track**: Which modality to generate
  - `"sequence"`: Generate amino acid sequence
  - `"structure"`: Generate 3D coordinates
  - `"function"`: Generate function annotations

- **num_steps**: Number of iterative demasking steps
  - Higher = slower but potentially better quality
  - Typical range: 8-100 depending on sequence length
  - For full sequence generation: approximately sequence_length / 2

- **temperature**: Controls randomness
  - 0.0: Fully deterministic (greedy decoding)
  - 0.5-0.7: Balanced exploration
  - 1.0: Maximum diversity
  - Higher values increase novelty but may reduce quality

- **top_p**: Nucleus sampling parameter
  - Limits sampling to top probability mass
  - Values: 0.0-1.0 (e.g., 0.9 = sample from top 90% probability mass)
  - Use for controlled diversity without extreme sampling

- **condition_on_coordinates_only**: Structure conditioning mode
  - `True`: Condition only on backbone coordinates (ignore sequence)
  - Useful for inverse folding tasks

### ESM3InferenceClient Interface

The unified interface for both local and remote inference.

**Local Model Loading:**

```python
from esm.models.esm3 import ESM3

# Load with automatic device placement
model = ESM3.from_pretrained("esm3-sm-open-v1").to("cuda")

# Or explicitly specify device
model = ESM3.from_pretrained("esm3-sm-open-v1").to("cpu")
```

**Generation Method:**

```python
# Basic generation
protein_output = model.generate(protein_input, config)

# With explicit track specification
protein_output = model.generate(
    protein_input,
    GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=16, temperature=0.6)
)
```

**Forward Pass (Advanced):**

```python
# Get raw model logits for custom sampling
protein_tensor = model.encode(protein)
output = model.forward(protein_tensor)
logits = model.decode(output)
```

## Common Usage Patterns

### 1. Sequence Completion

Fill in masked regions of a protein sequence:

```python
# Define partial sequence
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTK____LIVHSP____END")

# Generate missing positions
config = GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=12, temperature=0.5)
completed = model.generate(protein, config)

print(f"Original:  {protein.sequence}")
print(f"Completed: {completed.sequence}")
```

### 2. Structure Prediction

Predict 3D structure from sequence:

```python
# Input: sequence only
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSPQWFYK")

# Generate structure
config = GenerationConfig(track="structure", num_steps=len(protein.sequence))
protein_with_structure = model.generate(protein, config)

# Save as PDB
with open("predicted_structure.pdb", "w") as f:
    f.write(protein_with_structure.to_pdb())
```

### 3. Inverse Folding

Design sequence for a target structure:

```python
# Load target structure
target = ESMProtein.from_pdb("target.pdb")

# Remove sequence, keep structure
target.sequence = None

# Generate sequence that folds to this structure
config = GenerationConfig(
    track="sequence",
    num_steps=50,
    temperature=0.7,
    condition_on_coordinates_only=True
)
designed = model.generate(target, config)

print(f"Designed sequence: {designed.sequence}")
```

### 4. Function-Conditioned Generation

Generate protein with specific function:

```python
from esm.sdk.api import FunctionAnnotation

# Specify desired function
protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="_" * 150,
    function_annotations=[
        FunctionAnnotation(
            label="enzymatic_activity",
            start=30,
            end=90
        )
    ]
)

# Generate sequence with this function
config = GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=75, temperature=0.6)
functional_protein = model.generate(protein, config)
```

### 5. Multi-Track Generation (Chain-of-Thought)

Iteratively generate across multiple tracks:

```python
# Start with partial sequence
protein = ESMProtein(sequence="MPRT" + "_" * 100)

# Step 1: Complete sequence
protein = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=50, temperature=0.6)
)

# Step 2: Predict structure for completed sequence
protein = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="structure", num_steps=50)
)

# Step 3: Predict function
protein = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="function", num_steps=20)
)

print(f"Final sequence: {protein.sequence}")
print(f"Functions: {protein.function_annotations}")
```

### 6. Variant Generation

Generate multiple variants of a protein:

```python
import numpy as np

base_sequence = "MPRTKEINDAGLIVHSPQWFYK"
variants = []

for i in range(10):
    # Mask random positions
    seq_list = list(base_sequence)
    mask_indices = np.random.choice(len(seq_list), size=5, replace=False)
    for idx in mask_indices:
        seq_list[idx] = '_'

    protein = ESMProtein(sequence=''.join(seq_list))

    # Generate variant
    variant = model.generate(
        protein,
        GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=8, temperature=0.8)
    )
    variants.append(variant.sequence)

print(f"Generated {len(variants)} variants")
```

## Advanced Topics

### Temperature Scheduling

Vary temperature during generation for better control:

```python
def generate_with_temperature_schedule(model, protein, temperatures):
    """Generate with decreasing temperature for annealing."""
    current = protein
    steps_per_temp = 10

    for temp in temperatures:
        config = GenerationConfig(
            track="sequence",
            num_steps=steps_per_temp,
            temperature=temp
        )
        current = model.generate(current, config)

    return current

# Example: Start diverse, end deterministic
result = generate_with_temperature_schedule(
    model,
    protein,
    temperatures=[1.0, 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2]
)
```

### Constrained Generation

Preserve specific regions during generation:

```python
# Keep active site residues fixed
def mask_except_active_site(sequence, active_site_positions):
    """Mask everything except specified positions."""
    seq_list = ['_'] * len(sequence)
    for pos in active_site_positions:
        seq_list[pos] = sequence[pos]
    return ''.join(seq_list)

# Define active site
active_site = [23, 24, 25, 45, 46, 89]
constrained_seq = mask_except_active_site(original_sequence, active_site)

protein = ESMProtein(sequence=constrained_seq)
result = model.generate(protein, GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=50))
```

### Secondary Structure Conditioning

Use secondary structure information in generation:

```python
# Define secondary structure (H=helix, E=sheet, C=coil)
protein = ESMProtein(
    sequence="_" * 80,
    secondary_structure="CCHHHHHHHEEEEECCCHHHHHHCC" + "C" * 55
)

# Generate sequence with this structure
result = model.generate(
    protein,
    GenerationConfig(track="sequence", num_steps=40, temperature=0.6)
)
```

## Performance Optimization

### Memory Management

For large proteins or batch processing:

```python
import torch

# Clear CUDA cache between generations
torch.cuda.empty_cache()

# Use half precision for memory efficiency
model = ESM3.from_pretrained("esm3-sm-open-v1").to("cuda").half()

# Process in chunks for very long sequences
def chunk_generate(model, long_sequence, chunk_size=500):
    chunks = [long_sequence[i:i+chunk_size]
              for i in range(0, len(long_sequence), chunk_size)]
    results = []

    for chunk in chunks:
        protein = ESMProtein(sequence=chunk)
        result = model.generate(protein, GenerationConfig(track="sequence"))
        results.append(result.sequence)

    return ''.join(results)
```

### Batch Processing Tips

When processing multiple proteins:

1. Sort by sequence length for efficient batching
2. Use padding for similar-length sequences
3. Process on GPU when available
4. Implement checkpointing for long-running jobs
5. Use Forge API for large-scale processing (see `forge-api.md`)

## Error Handling

```python
try:
    protein = model.generate(protein_input, config)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Invalid input: {e}")
    # Handle invalid sequence or structure
except RuntimeError as e:
    print(f"Generation failed: {e}")
    # Handle model errors
except torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError:
    print("GPU out of memory - try smaller model or CPU")
    # Fallback to CPU or smaller model
```
