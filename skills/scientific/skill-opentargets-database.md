# Open Targets Database

## Overview

The Open Targets Platform is a comprehensive resource for systematic identification and prioritization of potential therapeutic drug targets. It integrates publicly available datasets including human genetics, omics, literature, and chemical data to build and score target-disease associations.

**Key capabilities:**
- Query target (gene) annotations including tractability, safety, expression
- Search for disease-target associations with evidence scores
- Retrieve evidence from multiple data types (genetics, pathways, literature, etc.)
- Find known drugs for diseases and their mechanisms
- Access drug information including clinical trial phases and adverse events
- Evaluate target druggability and therapeutic potential

**Data access:** The platform provides a GraphQL API, web interface, data downloads, and Google BigQuery access. This skill focuses on the GraphQL API for programmatic access.

## When to Use This Skill

This skill should be used when:

- **Target discovery:** Finding potential therapeutic targets for a disease
- **Target assessment:** Evaluating tractability, safety, and druggability of genes
- **Evidence gathering:** Retrieving supporting evidence for target-disease associations
- **Drug repurposing:** Identifying existing drugs that could be repurposed for new indications
- **Competitive intelligence:** Understanding clinical precedence and drug development landscape
- **Target prioritization:** Ranking targets based on genetic evidence and other data types
- **Mechanism research:** Investigating biological pathways and gene functions
- **Biomarker discovery:** Finding genes differentially expressed in disease
- **Safety assessment:** Identifying potential toxicity concerns for drug targets

## Core Workflow

### 1. Search for Entities

Start by finding the identifiers for targets, diseases, or drugs of interest.

**For targets (genes):**
```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import search_entities

# Search by gene symbol or name
results = search_entities("BRCA1", entity_types=["target"])
# Returns: [{"id": "ENSG00000012048", "name": "BRCA1", ...}]
```

**For diseases:**
```python
# Search by disease name
results = search_entities("alzheimer", entity_types=["disease"])
# Returns: [{"id": "EFO_0000249", "name": "Alzheimer disease", ...}]
```

**For drugs:**
```python
# Search by drug name
results = search_entities("aspirin", entity_types=["drug"])
# Returns: [{"id": "CHEMBL25", "name": "ASPIRIN", ...}]
```

**Identifiers used:**
- Targets: Ensembl gene IDs (e.g., `ENSG00000157764`)
- Diseases: EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology) IDs (e.g., `EFO_0000249`)
- Drugs: ChEMBL IDs (e.g., `CHEMBL25`)

### 2. Query Target Information

Refer to `references/target_annotations.md` for detailed information about all target features.

### 3. Query Disease Information

Get disease details and associated targets/drugs.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_disease_info

disease_info = get_disease_info("EFO_0000249", include_targets=True)

# Access fields:
# - name: Disease name
# - description: Disease description
# - therapeuticAreas: High-level disease categories
# - associatedTargets: Top targets with association scores
```

### 4. Retrieve Target-Disease Evidence

Get detailed evidence supporting a target-disease association.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_target_disease_evidence

# Get all evidence
evidence = get_target_disease_evidence(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    efo_id="EFO_0000249"
)

# Filter by evidence type
genetic_evidence = get_target_disease_evidence(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    efo_id="EFO_0000249",
    data_types=["genetic_association"]
)

# Each evidence record contains:
# - datasourceId: Specific data source (e.g., "gwas_catalog", "chembl")
# - datatypeId: Evidence category (e.g., "genetic_association", "known_drug")
# - score: Evidence strength (0-1)
# - studyId: Original study identifier
# - literature: Associated publications
```

**Major evidence types:**
1. **genetic_association:** GWAS, rare variants, ClinVar, gene burden
2. **somatic_mutation:** Cancer Gene Census, IntOGen, cancer biomarkers
3. **known_drug:** Clinical precedence from approved/clinical drugs
4. **affected_pathway:** CRISPR screens, pathway analyses, gene signatures
5. **rna_expression:** Differential expression from Expression Atlas
6. **animal_model:** Mouse phenotypes from IMPC
7. **literature:** Text-mining from Europe PMC

Refer to `references/evidence_types.md` for detailed descriptions of all evidence types and interpretation guidelines.

### 5. Find Known Drugs

Identify drugs used for a disease and their targets.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_known_drugs_for_disease

drugs = get_known_drugs_for_disease("EFO_0000249")

# drugs contains:
# - uniqueDrugs: Total number of unique drugs
# - uniqueTargets: Total number of unique targets

#   - drug: {name, drugType, maximumClinicalTrialPhase}
#   - targets: Genes targeted by the drug
#   - phase: Clinical trial phase for this indication
#   - status: Trial status (active, completed, etc.)
#   - mechanismOfAction: How drug works
```

**Clinical phases:**
- Phase 4: Approved drug
- Phase 3: Late-stage clinical trials
- Phase 2: Mid-stage trials
- Phase 1: Early safety trials

### 6. Get Drug Information

Retrieve detailed drug information including mechanisms and indications.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_drug_info

drug_info = get_drug_info("CHEMBL25")

# Access:
# - name, synonyms: Drug identifiers
# - drugType: Small molecule, antibody, etc.
# - maximumClinicalTrialPhase: Development stage
# - mechanismsOfAction: Target and action type
# - indications: Diseases with trial phases
# - withdrawnNotice: If withdrawn, reasons and countries
```

### 7. Get All Associations for a Target

Find all diseases associated with a target, optionally filtering by score.

```python
from scripts.query_opentargets import get_target_associations

# Get associations with score >= 0.5
associations = get_target_associations(
    ensembl_id="ENSG00000157764",
    min_score=0.5
)

# Each association contains:
# - disease: {id, name}
# - score: Overall association score (0-1)
# - datatypeScores: Breakdown by evidence type
```

**Association scores:**
- Range: 0-1 (higher = stronger evidence)
- Aggregate evidence across all data types using harmonic sum
- NOT confidence scores but relative ranking metrics
- Under-studied diseases may have lower scores despite good evidence

## Best Practices

### Target Prioritization Strategy

When prioritizing drug targets:

1. **Start with genetic evidence:** Human genetics (GWAS, rare variants) provides strongest disease relevance
2. **Check tractability:** Prefer targets with clinical or discovery precedence
3. **Assess safety:** Review safety liabilities, expression patterns, and genetic constraint
4. **Evaluate clinical precedence:** Known drugs indicate druggability and therapeutic window
5. **Consider multiple evidence types:** Convergent evidence from different sources increases confidence
6. **Validate mechanistically:** Pathway evidence and biological plausibility
7. **Review literature manually:** For critical decisions, examine primary publications

### Evidence Interpretation

**Strong evidence indicators:**
- Multiple independent evidence sources
- High genetic association scores (especially GWAS with L2G > 0.5)
- Clinical precedence from approved drugs
- ClinVar pathogenic variants with disease match
- Mouse models with relevant phenotypes

**Caution flags:**
- Single evidence source only
- Text-mining as sole evidence (requires manual validation)
- Conflicting evidence across sources
- High essentiality + ubiquitous expression (poor therapeutic window)
- Multiple safety liabilities

**Score interpretation:**
- Scores rank relative strength, not absolute confidence
- Under-studied diseases have lower scores despite potentially valid targets
- Weight expert-curated sources higher than computational predictions
- Check evidence breakdown, not just overall score

### Common Workflows

**Workflow 1: Target Discovery for a Disease**
1. Search for disease → get EFO ID

3. Check tractability (especially clinical precedence)
4. Review safety liabilities and genetic constraint
5. Examine disease associations to understand biology
6. Look for chemical probes or tool compounds
7. Check known drugs targeting gene for mechanism insights

**Workflow 3: Drug Repurposing**
1. Search for disease → get EFO ID
2. Get known drugs for disease
3. For each drug, get detailed drug info
4. Examine mechanisms of action and targets
5. Look for related disease indications
6. Assess clinical trial phases and status
7. Identify repurposing opportunities based on mechanism

**Workflow 4: Competitive Intelligence**
1. Search for target of interest

      }
    }
  }
"""

variables = {"ensemblId": "ENSG00000157764"}
```

## Annotation Interpretation Guidelines

### For Target Prioritization:

1. **Druggability (Tractability):**
   - Clinical precedence >> Discovery precedence > Predicted
   - Consider modality relevant to therapeutic approach
   - Check for existing tool compounds

2. **Safety Assessment:**
   - Review organ toxicity signals
   - Check expression in critical tissues
   - Assess genetic constraint (high = safety concern if inhibited)
   - Evaluate clinical adverse events from drugs

3. **Disease Relevance:**
   - Combine with association scores
   - Check expression in disease-relevant tissues
   - Review pathway context

4. **Validation Readiness:**
   - Chemical probes available?
   - Model organism data supportive?
   - Known drugs provide mechanism insight?

5. **Clinical Path Considerations:**
   - Pharmacogenetic factors
   - Expression pattern (tissue-specific is better for selectivity)
   - Essentiality (non-essential better for safety)

### Red Flags:

- **High essentiality + ubiquitous expression** - Poor therapeutic window
- **Multiple safety liabilities** - Toxicity concerns
- **High genetic constraint (pLI > 0.9)** - Critical gene, inhibition may be harmful
- **No tractability precedence** - Higher risk, longer development
- **Conflicting evidence** - Requires deeper investigation

### Green Flags:

- **Clinical precedence + related indication** - De-risked mechanism
- **Tissue-specific expression** - Better selectivity
- **Chemical probes available** - Faster validation
- **Low essentiality + disease relevance** - Good therapeutic window
- **Multiple evidence types converge** - Higher confidence

## Error Handling

GraphQL returns status code 200 even for errors. Check the response structure:

```python
if 'errors' in response_data:
    print(f"GraphQL errors: {response_data['errors']}")
else:
    print(f"Data: {response_data['data']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Request only needed fields** - Minimize data transfer and improve response time
2. **Use variables** - Make queries reusable and safer
3. **Handle pagination** - Most list fields support pagination with `page: {size: N, index: M}`
4. **Explore the schema** - Use the GraphQL browser to discover available fields
5. **Batch related queries** - Combine multiple entity fetches in a single query when possible
6. **Cache results** - Store frequently accessed data locally to reduce API calls
7. **Use BigQuery for bulk** - Switch to BigQuery/downloads for systematic analyses

### Evidence_Types

# Evidence Types and Data Sources

## Overview

Evidence represents any event or set of events that identifies a target as a potential causal gene or protein for a disease. Evidence is standardized and mapped to:
- **Ensembl gene IDs** for targets
- **EFO (Experimental Factor Ontology)** for diseases/phenotypes

Evidence is organized into **data types** (broader categories) and **data sources** (specific databases/studies).

## Evidence Data Types

### 1. Genetic Association

Evidence from human genetics linking genetic variants to disease phenotypes.

#### Data Sources:

**GWAS (Genome-Wide Association Studies)**
- Population-level common variant associations

- `mechanismOfAction`: How drug affects target

### 4. Affected Pathways

Evidence linking genes to disease through pathway perturbations and functional screens.

#### Data Sources:

**CRISPR Screens**
- Genome-scale knockout screens

- Baseline expression across tissues/conditions
- RNA-Seq and microarray studies
- Log2 fold-change and p-values

### 6. Animal Models

Evidence from in vivo studies showing phenotypes associated with gene perturbations.

#### Data Source:

**IMPC (International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium)**
- Systematic mouse knockout phenotypes
- Phenotype-disease mappings via ontologies
- Standardized phenotyping procedures

### 7. Literature

Evidence from text-mining of biomedical literature.

#### Data Source:

**Europe PMC**
- Co-occurrence of genes and diseases in abstracts
- Normalized citation counts
- Weighted by publication type and recency

## Evidence Scoring

Each evidence source has its own scoring methodology:

### Score Ranges
- Most scores normalized to 0-1 range
- Higher scores indicate stronger evidence
- Scores are NOT confidence levels but relative strength indicators

### Common Scoring Approaches:

**Binary Classifications:**
- ClinVar: Pathogenic (1.0), Likely pathogenic (0.99), etc.
- Gene2Phenotype: Confirmed/probable ratings
- PanelApp: Green/amber/red classifications

**Statistical Measures:**
- GWAS: L2G scores incorporating multiple lines of evidence
- Gene Burden: Statistical significance of variant aggregation
- Expression: Adjusted p-values and fold-changes

**Clinical Precedence:**
- Known Drugs: Phase weights (Phase 4 = 1.0, Phase 3 = 0.8, etc.)
- Clinical status modifiers

**Computational Predictions:**
- IntOGen: Q-values from driver mutation analysis
- PROGENy/SLAPenrich: Pathway activity/enrichment scores

## Evidence Interpretation Guidelines

### Strengths by Data Type

**Genetic Association** - Strongest human genetic evidence
- Direct link between genetic variation and disease
- Mendelian diseases: high confidence
- GWAS: requires L2G to identify causal gene
- Consider ancestry and population-specific effects

**Somatic Mutations** - Direct evidence in cancer
- Strong for oncology indications
- Driver mutations indicate therapeutic potential
- Consider cancer type specificity

**Known Drugs** - Clinical validation
- Highest confidence: approved drugs (Phase 4)
- Consider mechanism relevance to new indication
- Phase 1-2: early evidence, higher risk

**Affected Pathways** - Mechanistic insights
- Supports biological plausibility
- May not predict clinical success
- Useful for hypothesis generation

**RNA Expression** - Observational evidence
- Correlation, not causation
- May reflect disease consequence vs. cause
- Useful for biomarker identification

**Animal Models** - Translational evidence
- Strong for understanding biology
- Variable translation to human disease
- Most useful when phenotype matches human disease

**Literature** - Exploratory signal
- Text-mining captures research focus
- May reflect publication bias
- Requires manual literature review for validation

### Important Considerations

1. **Multiple evidence types strengthen confidence** - Convergent evidence from different data types provides stronger support

2. **Under-studied diseases score lower** - Novel or rare diseases may have strong evidence but lower aggregate scores due to limited research

3. **Association scores are not probabilities** - Scores rank relative evidence strength, not success probability

4. **Context matters** - Evidence strength depends on:
   - Disease mechanism understanding
   - Target biology and druggability
   - Clinical precedence in related indications
   - Safety considerations

5. **Data source reliability varies** - Weight expert-curated sources (ClinGen, Gene2Phenotype) higher than computational predictions

## Using Evidence in Queries

### Filtering by Data Type

```python
query = """
  query evidenceByType($ensemblId: String!, $efoId: String!, $dataTypes: [String!]) {
    disease(efoId: $efoId) {
      evidences(ensemblIds: [$ensemblId], datatypes: $dataTypes) {
        rows {
          datasourceId
          score
        }
      }
    }
  }
"""
variables = {
    "ensemblId": "ENSG00000157764",
    "efoId": "EFO_0000249",
    "dataTypes": ["genetic_association", "somatic_mutation"]
}
```

### Accessing Data Type Scores

Data type scores aggregate all source scores within that type:

```python
query = """
  query associationScores($ensemblId: String!, $efoId: String!) {
    target(ensemblId: $ensemblId) {
      associatedDiseases(efoIds: [$efoId]) {
        rows {
          disease {
            name
          }
          score
          datatypeScores {
            componentId
            score
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
"""
```

## Evidence Quality Assessment

When evaluating evidence:

1. **Check multiple sources** - Single source may be unreliable
2. **Prioritize human genetic evidence** - Strongest disease relevance
3. **Consider clinical precedence** - Known drugs indicate druggability
4. **Assess mechanistic support** - Pathway evidence supports biology
5. **Review literature manually** - For critical decisions, read primary publications
6. **Validate in primary databases** - Cross-reference with ClinVar, ClinGen, etc.
