## Quick Start Examples

### Upload and Analyze Data

```python
import dxpy

# Upload input file
input_file = dxpy.upload_local_file("sample.fastq", project="project-xxxx")

# Run analysis
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run({
    "reads": dxpy.dxlink(input_file.get_id())
})

# Wait for completion
job.wait_on_done()

# Download results
output_id = job.describe()["output"]["aligned_reads"]["$dnanexus_link"]
dxpy.download_dxfile(output_id, "aligned.bam")
```

### Search and Download Files

```python
import dxpy

# Find BAM files from a specific experiment
files = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    name="*.bam",
    properties={"experiment": "exp001"},
    project="project-xxxx"
)

# Download each file
for file_result in files:
    file_obj = dxpy.DXFile(file_result["id"])
    filename = file_obj.describe()["name"]
    dxpy.download_dxfile(file_result["id"], filename)
```

### Create Simple App

```python
# src/my-app.py
import dxpy
import subprocess

@dxpy.entry_point('main')
def main(input_file, quality_threshold=30):
    # Download input
    dxpy.download_dxfile(input_file["$dnanexus_link"], "input.fastq")

    # Process
    subprocess.check_call([
        "quality_filter",
        "--input", "input.fastq",
        "--output", "filtered.fastq",
        "--threshold", str(quality_threshold)
    ])

    # Upload output
    output_file = dxpy.upload_local_file("filtered.fastq")

    return {
        "filtered_reads": dxpy.dxlink(output_file)
    }

dxpy.run()
```

## Workflow Decision Tree

When working with DNAnexus, follow this decision tree:

1. **Need to create a new executable?**
   - Yes → Use **App Development** (references/app-development.md)
   - No → Continue to step 2

2. **Need to manage files or data?**
   - Yes → Use **Data Operations** (references/data-operations.md)
   - No → Continue to step 3

3. **Need to run an analysis or workflow?**
   - Yes → Use **Job Execution** (references/job-execution.md)
   - No → Continue to step 4

4. **Writing Python scripts for automation?**
   - Yes → Use **Python SDK** (references/python-sdk.md)
   - No → Continue to step 5

5. **Configuring app settings or dependencies?**
   - Yes → Use **Configuration** (references/configuration.md)

Often you'll need multiple capabilities together (e.g., app development + configuration, or data operations + job execution).

## Installation and Authentication

### Install dxpy

```bash
uv pip install dxpy
```

### Login to DNAnexus

```bash
dx login
```

This authenticates your session and sets up access to projects and data.

### Verify Installation

```bash
dx --version
dx whoami
```

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Batch Processing

Process multiple files with the same analysis:

```python
# Find all FASTQ files
files = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    name="*.fastq",
    project="project-xxxx"
)

# Launch parallel jobs
jobs = []
for file_result in files:
    job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run({
        "input": dxpy.dxlink(file_result["id"])
    })
    jobs.append(job)

# Wait for all completions
for job in jobs:
    job.wait_on_done()
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Step Pipeline

Chain multiple analyses together:

```python
# Step 1: Quality control
qc_job = qc_applet.run({"reads": input_file})

# Step 2: Alignment (uses QC output)
align_job = align_applet.run({
    "reads": qc_job.get_output_ref("filtered_reads")
})

# Step 3: Variant calling (uses alignment output)
variant_job = variant_applet.run({
    "bam": align_job.get_output_ref("aligned_bam")
})
```

### Pattern 3: Data Organization

Organize analysis results systematically:

```python
# Create organized folder structure
dxpy.api.project_new_folder(
    "project-xxxx",
    {"folder": "/experiments/exp001/results", "parents": True}
)

# Upload with metadata
result_file = dxpy.upload_local_file(
    "results.txt",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/experiments/exp001/results",
    properties={
        "experiment": "exp001",
        "sample": "sample1",
        "analysis_date": "2025-10-20"
    },
    tags=["validated", "published"]
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Always wrap API calls in try-except blocks
2. **Resource Management**: Choose appropriate instance types for workloads
3. **Data Organization**: Use consistent folder structures and metadata
4. **Cost Optimization**: Archive old data, use appropriate storage classes
5. **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions in dxapp.json
6. **Testing**: Test apps with various input types before production use
7. **Version Control**: Use semantic versioning for apps
8. **Security**: Never hardcode credentials in source code
9. **Logging**: Include informative log messages for debugging
10. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files and failed jobs

## 📚 Reference Materials


### Data Operations

# DNAnexus Data Operations

## Overview

DNAnexus provides comprehensive data management capabilities for files, records, databases, and other data objects. All data operations can be performed via the Python SDK (dxpy) or command-line interface (dx).

## Data Object Types

### Files
Binary or text data stored on the platform.

### Records
Structured data objects with arbitrary JSON details and metadata.

### Databases
Structured database objects for relational data.

### Applets and Apps
Executable programs (covered in app-development.md).

### Workflows
Multi-step analysis pipelines.

## Data Object Lifecycle

### States

**Open State**: Data can be modified
- Files: Contents can be written
- Records: Details can be updated
- Applets: Created in closed state by default

**Closed State**: Data becomes immutable
- File contents are fixed
- Metadata fields are locked (types, details, links, visibility)
- Objects are ready for sharing and analysis

### Transitions

```
Create (open) → Modify → Close (immutable)
```

Most objects start open and require explicit closure:
```python
# Close a file
file_obj.close()
```

Some objects can be created and closed in one operation:
```python
# Create closed record
record = dxpy.new_dxrecord(details={...}, close=True)
```

## File Operations

### Uploading Files

**From local file**:
```python
import dxpy

# Upload a file
file_obj = dxpy.upload_local_file("data.txt", project="project-xxxx")
print(f"Uploaded: {file_obj.get_id()}")
```

**With metadata**:
```python
file_obj = dxpy.upload_local_file(
    "data.txt",
    name="my_data",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/results",
    properties={"sample": "sample1", "type": "raw"},
    tags=["experiment1", "batch2"]
)
```

**Streaming upload**:
```python
# For large files or generated data
file_obj = dxpy.new_dxfile(project="project-xxxx", name="output.txt")
file_obj.write("Line 1\n")
file_obj.write("Line 2\n")
file_obj.close()
```

### Downloading Files

**To local file**:
```python
# Download by ID
dxpy.download_dxfile("file-xxxx", "local_output.txt")

# Download using handler
file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx")
dxpy.download_dxfile(file_obj.get_id(), "local_output.txt")
```

**Read file contents**:
```python
file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx")
with file_obj.open_file() as f:
    contents = f.read()
```

**Download to specific directory**:
```python
dxpy.download_dxfile("file-xxxx", "/path/to/directory/filename.txt")
```

### File Metadata

**Get file information**:
```python
file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx")
describe = file_obj.describe()

print(f"Name: {describe['name']}")
print(f"Size: {describe['size']} bytes")
print(f"State: {describe['state']}")
print(f"Created: {describe['created']}")
```

**Update file metadata**:
```python
file_obj.set_properties({"experiment": "exp1", "version": "v2"})
file_obj.add_tags(["validated", "published"])
file_obj.rename("new_name.txt")
```

## Record Operations

Records store structured metadata with arbitrary JSON.

### Creating Records

```python
# Create a record
record = dxpy.new_dxrecord(
    name="sample_metadata",
    types=["SampleMetadata"],
    details={
        "sample_id": "S001",
        "tissue": "blood",
        "age": 45,
        "conditions": ["diabetes"]
    },
    project="project-xxxx",
    close=True
)
```

### Reading Records

```python
record = dxpy.DXRecord("record-xxxx")
describe = record.describe()

# Access details
details = record.get_details()
sample_id = details["sample_id"]
tissue = details["tissue"]
```

### Updating Records

```python
# Record must be open to update
record = dxpy.DXRecord("record-xxxx")
details = record.get_details()
details["processed"] = True
record.set_details(details)
record.close()
```

## Search and Discovery

### Finding Data Objects

**Search by name**:
```python
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    name="*.fastq",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/raw_data"
)

for result in results:
    print(f"{result['describe']['name']}: {result['id']}")
```

**Search by properties**:
```python
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    properties={"sample": "sample1", "type": "processed"},
    project="project-xxxx"
)
```

**Search by type**:
```python
# Find all records of specific type
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="record",
    typename="SampleMetadata",
    project="project-xxxx"
)
```

**Search with state filter**:
```python
# Find only closed files
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    state="closed",
    project="project-xxxx"
)
```

### System-wide Search

```python
# Search across all accessible projects
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    name="important_data.txt",
    describe=True  # Include full descriptions
)
```

## Cloning and Copying

### Clone Data Between Projects

```python
# Clone file to another project
new_file = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx").clone(
    project="project-yyyy",
    folder="/imported_data"
)
```

### Clone Multiple Objects

```python
# Clone folder contents
files = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/results"
)

for file in files:
    file_obj = dxpy.DXFile(file['id'])
    file_obj.clone(project="project-yyyy", folder="/backup")
```

## Project Management

### Creating Projects

```python
# Create a new project
project = dxpy.api.project_new({
    "name": "My Analysis Project",
    "description": "RNA-seq analysis for experiment X"
})

project_id = project['id']
```

### Project Permissions

```python
# Invite user to project
dxpy.api.project_invite(
    project_id,
    {
        "invitee": "user-xxxx",
        "level": "CONTRIBUTE"  # VIEW, UPLOAD, CONTRIBUTE, ADMINISTER
    }
)
```

### List Projects

```python
# List accessible projects
projects = dxpy.find_projects(describe=True)

for proj in projects:
    desc = proj['describe']
    print(f"{desc['name']}: {proj['id']}")
```

## Folder Operations

### Creating Folders

```python
# Create nested folders
dxpy.api.project_new_folder(
    "project-xxxx",
    {"folder": "/analysis/batch1/results", "parents": True}
)
```

### Moving Objects

```python
# Move file to different folder
file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx", project="project-xxxx")
file_obj.move("/new_location")
```

### Removing Objects

```python
# Remove file from project (not permanent deletion)
dxpy.api.project_remove_objects(
    "project-xxxx",
    {"objects": ["file-xxxx"]}
)

# Permanent deletion
file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx")
file_obj.remove()
```

## Archival

### Archive Data

Archived data is moved to cheaper long-term storage:

```python
# Archive a file
dxpy.api.project_archive(
    "project-xxxx",
    {"files": ["file-xxxx"]}
)
```

### Unarchive Data

```python
# Unarchive when needed
dxpy.api.project_unarchive(
    "project-xxxx",
    {"files": ["file-xxxx"]}
)
```

## Batch Operations

### Upload Multiple Files

```python
import os

# Upload all files in directory
for filename in os.listdir("./data"):
    filepath = os.path.join("./data", filename)
    if os.path.isfile(filepath):
        dxpy.upload_local_file(
            filepath,
            project="project-xxxx",
            folder="/batch_upload"
        )
```

### Download Multiple Files

```python
# Download all files from folder
files = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/results"
)

for file in files:
    file_obj = dxpy.DXFile(file['id'])
    filename = file_obj.describe()['name']
    dxpy.download_dxfile(file['id'], f"./downloads/{filename}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Close Files**: Always close files after writing to make them accessible
2. **Use Properties**: Tag data with meaningful properties for easier discovery
3. **Organize Folders**: Use logical folder structures
4. **Clean Up**: Remove temporary or obsolete data
5. **Batch Operations**: Group operations when processing many objects
6. **Error Handling**: Check object states before operations
7. **Permissions**: Verify project permissions before data operations
8. **Archive Old Data**: Use archival for long-term storage cost savings

{
  "systemRequirements": {
    "main": {
      "clusterSpec": {
        "type": "spark",
        "version": "3.1.2",
        "initialInstanceCount": 3,

        "bootstrapScript": "bootstrap.sh"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Regional Options

Deploy apps across regions:

```json
{
  "regionalOptions": {
    "aws:us-east-1": {
      "systemRequirements": {
        "*": {"instanceType": "mem2_ssd1_v2_x4"}
      },
      "assetDepends": [
        {"id": "record-xxxx"}
      ]
    },

      "systemRequirements": {
        "*": {"instanceType": "azure:mem2_ssd1_x4"}
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Dependency Management

### System Packages (execDepends)

Install Ubuntu packages at runtime:

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "samtools"},
      {"name": "bwa"},
      {"name": "python3-pip"},
      {"name": "r-base", "version": "4.0.0"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Packages are installed using `apt-get` from Ubuntu repositories.

### Python Dependencies

#### Option 1: Install via pip in execDepends

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "python3-pip"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Then in your app script:
```python
import subprocess
subprocess.check_call(["pip", "install", "numpy==1.24.0", "pandas==2.0.0"])
```

#### Option 2: Requirements file

Create `resources/requirements.txt`:
```
numpy==1.24.0
pandas==2.0.0
scikit-learn==1.3.0
```

In your app:
```python
subprocess.check_call(["pip", "install", "-r", "requirements.txt"])
```

### Bundled Dependencies

Include custom tools or libraries in the app:

**File structure**:
```
my-app/
├── dxapp.json
├── src/
│   └── my-app.py
└── resources/
    ├── tools/
    │   └── custom_tool
    └── scripts/
        └── helper.py
```

Access resources in app:
```python
import os

# Resources are in parent directory
resources_dir = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), "..", "resources")
tool_path = os.path.join(resources_dir, "tools", "custom_tool")

# Run bundled tool
subprocess.check_call([tool_path, "arg1", "arg2"])
```

### Asset Dependencies

Assets are pre-built bundles of dependencies that can be shared across apps.

#### Using Assets

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "assetDepends": [
      {
        "name": "bwa-asset",
        "id": {"$dnanexus_link": "record-xxxx"}
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Assets are mounted at runtime and accessible via environment variable:
```python
import os
asset_dir = os.environ.get("DX_ASSET_BWA")
bwa_path = os.path.join(asset_dir, "bin", "bwa")
```

#### Creating Assets

Create asset directory:
```bash
mkdir bwa-asset
cd bwa-asset
# Install software
./configure --prefix=$PWD/usr/local
make && make install
```

Build asset:
```bash
dx build_asset bwa-asset --destination=project-xxxx:/assets/
```

## Docker Integration

### Using Docker Images

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "interpreter": "python3",
    "file": "src/my-app.py",
    "distribution": "Ubuntu",
    "release": "24.04",
    "systemRequirements": {
      "*": {
        "instanceType": "mem2_ssd1_v2_x4"
      }
    },
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "docker.io"}
    ]
  }
}
```

Use Docker in app:
```python
import subprocess

# Pull Docker image
subprocess.check_call(["docker", "pull", "biocontainers/samtools:v1.9"])

# Run command in container
subprocess.check_call([
    "docker", "run",
    "-v", f"{os.getcwd()}:/data",
    "biocontainers/samtools:v1.9",
    "samtools", "view", "/data/input.bam"
])
```

### Docker as Base Image

For apps that run entirely in Docker:

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "interpreter": "bash",
    "file": "src/wrapper.sh",
    "distribution": "Ubuntu",
    "release": "24.04",
    "execDepends": [
      {"name": "docker.io"}
    ]
  }
}
```

## Access Requirements

Request special permissions:

```json
{
  "access": {
    "network": ["*"],           // Internet access
    "project": "CONTRIBUTE",    // Project write access
    "allProjects": "VIEW",      // Read other projects
    "developer": true           // Advanced permissions
  }
}
```

**Network access**:
- `["*"]` - Full internet
- `["github.com", "pypi.org"]` - Specific domains

## Timeout Configuration

```json
{
  "runSpec": {
    "timeoutPolicy": {
      "*": {
        "days": 1,
        "hours": 12,
        "minutes": 30
      }
    }
  }
}
```

  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Version Management**: Use semantic versioning for apps
2. **Instance Type**: Start with smaller instances, scale up as needed
3. **Dependencies**: Document all dependencies clearly
4. **Error Messages**: Provide helpful error messages for invalid inputs
5. **Testing**: Test with various input types and sizes
6. **Documentation**: Write clear descriptions and help text
7. **Resources**: Bundle frequently-used tools to avoid repeated downloads
8. **Docker**: Use Docker for complex dependency chains
9. **Assets**: Create assets for heavy dependencies shared across apps
10. **Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts based on expected runtime
11. **Network Access**: Request only necessary network permissions
12. **Region Support**: Use regionalOptions for multi-region apps

# List folder contents
contents = project.list_folder("/data")
print(f"Objects: {contents['objects']}")
print(f"Folders: {contents['folders']}")
```

## High-Level Functions

### File Operations

```python
# Upload file
file_obj = dxpy.upload_local_file(
    "local_file.txt",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/data",
    name="uploaded_file.txt"
)

# Download file
dxpy.download_dxfile("file-xxxx", "downloaded.txt")

# Upload string as file
file_obj = dxpy.upload_string("Hello World", project="project-xxxx")
```

### Creating Data Objects

```python
# New file
file_obj = dxpy.new_dxfile(
    project="project-xxxx",
    name="output.txt"
)
file_obj.write("content")
file_obj.close()

# New record
record = dxpy.new_dxrecord(
    name="metadata",
    details={"key": "value"},
    project="project-xxxx"
)
```

### Search Functions

```python
# Find data objects
results = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    name="*.fastq",
    project="project-xxxx",
    folder="/raw_data",
    describe=True
)

for result in results:
    print(f"{result['describe']['name']}: {result['id']}")

# Find projects
projects = dxpy.find_projects(
    name="*analysis*",
    describe=True
)

# Find jobs
jobs = dxpy.find_jobs(
    project="project-xxxx",
    created_after="2025-01-01",
    state="failed"
)

# Find apps
apps = dxpy.find_apps(
    category="Read Mapping"
)
```

### Links and References

```python
# Create link to data object
link = dxpy.dxlink("file-xxxx")
# Returns: {"$dnanexus_link": "file-xxxx"}

# Create link with project
link = dxpy.dxlink("file-xxxx", "project-yyyy")

# Get job output reference (for chaining jobs)
output_ref = job.get_output_ref("output_name")
```

## API Methods

### Direct API Calls

For operations not covered by high-level functions:

```python
# Call API method directly
result = dxpy.api.project_new({
    "name": "New Project",
    "description": "Created via API"
})

project_id = result["id"]

# File describe
file_desc = dxpy.api.file_describe("file-xxxx")

# System find data objects
results = dxpy.api.system_find_data_objects({
    "class": "file",
    "project": "project-xxxx",
    "name": {"regexp": ".*\\.bam$"}
})
```

### Common API Methods

```python
# Project operations
dxpy.api.project_invite("project-xxxx", {"invitee": "user-yyyy", "level": "VIEW"})
dxpy.api.project_new_folder("project-xxxx", {"folder": "/new_folder"})

# File operations
dxpy.api.file_close("file-xxxx")
dxpy.api.file_remove("file-xxxx")

# Job operations
dxpy.api.job_terminate("job-xxxx")
dxpy.api.job_get_log("job-xxxx")
```

## App Development Functions

### Entry Points

```python
import dxpy

@dxpy.entry_point('main')
def main(input1, input2):
    """Main entry point for app"""
    # Process inputs
    result = process(input1, input2)

    # Return outputs
    return {
        "output1": result
    }

# Required at end of app code
dxpy.run()
```

### Creating Subjobs

```python
# Spawn subjob within app
subjob = dxpy.new_dxjob(
    fn_input={"input": value},
    fn_name="helper_function"
)

# Get output reference
output_ref = subjob.get_output_ref("result")

@dxpy.entry_point('helper_function')
def helper_function(input):
    # Process
    return {"result": output}
```

## Error Handling

### Exception Types

```python
import dxpy
from dxpy.exceptions import DXError, DXAPIError

try:
    file_obj = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx")
    desc = file_obj.describe()
except DXAPIError as e:
    print(f"API Error: {e}")
    print(f"Status Code: {e.code}")
except DXError as e:
    print(f"General Error: {e}")
```

### Common Exceptions

- `DXAPIError`: API request failed
- `DXError`: General DNAnexus error
- `ResourceNotFound`: Object doesn't exist
- `PermissionDenied`: Insufficient permissions
- `InvalidInput`: Invalid input parameters

## Utility Functions

### Getting Handlers

```python
# Get handler from ID/link
handler = dxpy.get_handler("file-xxxx")
# Returns DXFile, DXRecord, etc. based on object class

# Bind handler to project
handler = dxpy.DXFile("file-xxxx", project="project-yyyy")
```

### Describe Methods

```python
# Describe any object
desc = dxpy.describe("file-xxxx")
print(desc)

# Describe with fields
desc = dxpy.describe("file-xxxx", fields={"name": True, "size": True})
```

## Configuration

### Setting Project Context

```python
# Set default project
dxpy.set_workspace_id("project-xxxx")

# Get current project
project_id = dxpy.WORKSPACE_ID
```

### Setting Region

```python
# Set API server
dxpy.set_api_server_info(host="api.dnanexus.com", port=443)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Use High-Level Functions**: Prefer `upload_local_file()` over manual file creation
2. **Handler Reuse**: Create handlers once and reuse them
3. **Batch Operations**: Use find functions to process multiple objects
4. **Error Handling**: Always wrap API calls in try-except blocks
5. **Close Objects**: Remember to close files and records after modifications
6. **Project Context**: Set workspace context for apps
7. **API Token Security**: Never hardcode tokens in source code
8. **Describe Fields**: Request only needed fields to reduce latency
9. **Search Filters**: Use specific filters to narrow search results
10. **Link Format**: Use `dxpy.dxlink()` for consistent link creation

## Common Patterns

### Upload and Process Pattern

```python
# Upload input
input_file = dxpy.upload_local_file("data.txt", project="project-xxxx")

# Run analysis
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run({
    "input": dxpy.dxlink(input_file.get_id())
})

# Wait and download result
job.wait_on_done()
output_id = job.describe()["output"]["result"]["$dnanexus_link"]
dxpy.download_dxfile(output_id, "result.txt")
```

### Batch File Processing

```python
# Find all FASTQ files
files = dxpy.find_data_objects(
    classname="file",
    name="*.fastq",
    project="project-xxxx"
)

# Process each file
jobs = []
for file_result in files:
    job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run({
        "input": dxpy.dxlink(file_result["id"])
    })
    jobs.append(job)

# Wait for all jobs
for job in jobs:
    job.wait_on_done()
    print(f"Job {job.get_id()} completed")
```

### Workflow with Dependencies

```python
# Job 1
job1 = applet1.run({"input": data})

# Job 2 depends on job1 output
job2 = applet2.run({
    "input": job1.get_output_ref("result")
})

# Job 3 depends on job2
job3 = applet3.run({
    "input": job2.get_output_ref("processed")
})

# Wait for final result
job3.wait_on_done()
```




### Job Execution

# DNAnexus Job Execution and Workflows

## Overview

Jobs are the fundamental execution units on DNAnexus. When an applet or app runs, a job is created and executed on a worker node in an isolated Linux environment with constant API access.

## Job Types

### Origin Jobs
Initially created by users or automated systems.

### Master Jobs
Result from directly launching an executable (app/applet).

### Child Jobs
Spawned by parent jobs for parallel processing or sub-workflows.

## Running Jobs

### Running an Applet

**Basic execution**:
```python
import dxpy

# Run an applet
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run({
    "input1": {"$dnanexus_link": "file-yyyy"},
    "input2": "parameter_value"
})

print(f"Job ID: {job.get_id()}")
```

**Using command line**:
```bash
dx run applet-xxxx -i input1=file-yyyy -i input2="value"
```

### Running an App

```python
# Run an app by name
job = dxpy.DXApp(name="my-app").run({
    "reads": {"$dnanexus_link": "file-xxxx"},
    "quality_threshold": 30
})
```

### Specifying Execution Parameters

```python
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run(
    applet_input={
        "input_file": {"$dnanexus_link": "file-yyyy"}
    },
    project="project-zzzz",  # Output project
    folder="/results",        # Output folder
    name="My Analysis Job",   # Job name
    instance_type="mem2_hdd2_x4",  # Override instance type
    priority="high"           # Job priority
)
```

## Job Monitoring

### Checking Job Status

```python
job = dxpy.DXJob("job-xxxx")
state = job.describe()["state"]

# States: idle, waiting_on_input, runnable, running, done, failed, terminated
print(f"Job state: {state}")
```

**Using command line**:
```bash
dx watch job-xxxx
```

### Waiting for Job Completion

```python
# Block until job completes
job.wait_on_done()

# Check if successful
if job.describe()["state"] == "done":
    output = job.describe()["output"]
    print(f"Job completed: {output}")
else:
    print("Job failed")
```

### Getting Job Output

```python
job = dxpy.DXJob("job-xxxx")

# Wait for completion
job.wait_on_done()

# Get outputs
output = job.describe()["output"]
output_file_id = output["result_file"]["$dnanexus_link"]

# Download result
dxpy.download_dxfile(output_file_id, "result.txt")
```

### Job Output References

Create references to job outputs before they complete:

```python
# Launch first job
job1 = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-1").run({"input": "..."})

# Launch second job using output reference
job2 = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-2").run({
    "input": dxpy.dxlink(job1.get_output_ref("output_name"))
})
```

## Job Logs

### Viewing Logs

**Command line**:
```bash
dx watch job-xxxx --get-streams
```

**Programmatically**:
```python
import sys

# Get job logs
job = dxpy.DXJob("job-xxxx")
log = dxpy.api.job_get_log(job.get_id())

for log_entry in log["loglines"]:
    print(log_entry)
```

## Parallel Execution

### Creating Subjobs

```python
@dxpy.entry_point('main')
def main(input_files):
    # Create subjobs for parallel processing
    subjobs = []

    for input_file in input_files:
        subjob = dxpy.new_dxjob(
            fn_input={"file": input_file},
            fn_name="process_file"
        )
        subjobs.append(subjob)

    # Collect results
    results = []
    for subjob in subjobs:
        result = subjob.get_output_ref("processed_file")
        results.append(result)

    return {"all_results": results}

@dxpy.entry_point('process_file')
def process_file(file):
    # Process single file
    # ...
    return {"processed_file": output_file}
```

### Scatter-Gather Pattern

```python
# Scatter: Process items in parallel
scatter_jobs = []
for item in items:
    job = dxpy.new_dxjob(
        fn_input={"item": item},
        fn_name="process_item"
    )
    scatter_jobs.append(job)

# Gather: Combine results
gather_job = dxpy.new_dxjob(
    fn_input={
        "results": [job.get_output_ref("result") for job in scatter_jobs]
    },
    fn_name="combine_results"
)
```

## Workflows

Workflows combine multiple apps/applets into multi-step pipelines.

### Creating a Workflow

```python
# Create workflow
workflow = dxpy.new_dxworkflow(
    name="My Analysis Pipeline",
    project="project-xxxx"
)

# Add stages
stage1 = workflow.add_stage(
    dxpy.DXApplet("applet-1"),
    name="Quality Control",
    folder="/qc"
)

stage2 = workflow.add_stage(
    dxpy.DXApplet("applet-2"),
    name="Alignment",
    folder="/alignment"
)

# Connect stages
stage2.set_input("reads", stage1.get_output_ref("filtered_reads"))

# Close workflow
workflow.close()
```

### Running a Workflow

```python
# Run workflow
analysis = workflow.run({
    "stage-xxxx.input1": {"$dnanexus_link": "file-yyyy"}
})

# Monitor analysis (collection of jobs)
analysis.wait_on_done()

# Get workflow outputs
outputs = analysis.describe()["output"]
```

**Using command line**:
```bash
dx run workflow-xxxx -i stage-1.input=file-yyyy
```

## Job Permissions and Context

### Workspace Context

Jobs run in a workspace project with cloned input data:
- Jobs require `CONTRIBUTE` permission to workspace
- Jobs need `VIEW` access to source projects
- All charges accumulate to the originating project

### Data Requirements

Jobs cannot start until:
1. All input data objects are in `closed` state
2. Required permissions are available
3. Resources are allocated

Output objects must reach `closed` state before workspace cleanup.

## Job Lifecycle

```
Created → Waiting on Input → Runnable → Running → Done/Failed
```

**States**:
- `idle`: Job created but not yet queued
- `waiting_on_input`: Waiting for input data objects to close
- `runnable`: Ready to run, waiting for resources
- `running`: Currently executing
- `done`: Completed successfully
- `failed`: Execution failed
- `terminated`: Manually stopped

## Error Handling

### Job Failure

```python
job = dxpy.DXJob("job-xxxx")
job.wait_on_done()

desc = job.describe()
if desc["state"] == "failed":
    print(f"Job failed: {desc.get('failureReason', 'Unknown')}")
    print(f"Failure message: {desc.get('failureMessage', '')}")
```

### Retry Failed Jobs

```python
# Rerun failed job
new_job = dxpy.DXApplet(desc["applet"]).run(
    desc["originalInput"],
    project=desc["project"]
)
```

### Terminating Jobs

```python
# Stop a running job
job = dxpy.DXJob("job-xxxx")
job.terminate()
```

**Using command line**:
```bash
dx terminate job-xxxx
```

## Resource Management

### Instance Types

Specify computational resources:

```python
# Run with specific instance type
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run(
    {"input": "..."},
    instance_type="mem3_ssd1_v2_x8"  # 8 cores, high memory, SSD
)
```

Common instance types:
- `mem1_ssd1_v2_x4` - 4 cores, standard memory
- `mem2_ssd1_v2_x8` - 8 cores, high memory
- `mem3_ssd1_v2_x16` - 16 cores, very high memory
- `mem1_ssd1_v2_x36` - 36 cores for parallel workloads

### Timeout Settings

Set maximum execution time:

```python
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run(
    {"input": "..."},
    timeout="24h"  # Maximum runtime
)
```

## Job Tagging and Metadata

### Add Job Tags

```python
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run(
    {"input": "..."},
    tags=["experiment1", "batch2", "production"]
)
```

### Add Job Properties

```python
job = dxpy.DXApplet("applet-xxxx").run(
    {"input": "..."},
    properties={
        "experiment": "exp001",
        "sample": "sample1",
        "batch": "batch2"
    }
)
```

### Finding Jobs

```python
# Find jobs by tag
jobs = dxpy.find_jobs(
    project="project-xxxx",
    tags=["experiment1"],
    describe=True
)

for job in jobs:
    print(f"{job['describe']['name']}: {job['id']}")
```

## Best Practices

1. **Job Naming**: Use descriptive names for easier tracking
2. **Tags and Properties**: Tag jobs for organization and searchability
3. **Resource Selection**: Choose appropriate instance types for workload
4. **Error Handling**: Check job state and handle failures gracefully
5. **Parallel Processing**: Use subjobs for independent parallel tasks
6. **Workflows**: Use workflows for complex multi-step analyses
7. **Monitoring**: Monitor long-running jobs and check logs for issues
8. **Cost Management**: Use appropriate instance types to balance cost/performance
9. **Timeouts**: Set reasonable timeouts to prevent runaway jobs
10. **Cleanup**: Remove failed or obsolete jobs

## Debugging Tips

1. **Check Logs**: Always review job logs for error messages
2. **Verify Inputs**: Ensure input files are closed and accessible
3. **Test Locally**: Test logic locally before deploying to platform
4. **Start Small**: Test with small datasets before scaling up
5. **Monitor Resources**: Check if job is running out of memory or disk space
6. **Instance Type**: Try larger instance if job fails due to resources




### App Development

# DNAnexus App Development

## Overview

Apps and applets are executable programs that run on the DNAnexus platform. They can be written in Python or Bash and are deployed with all necessary dependencies and configuration.

## Applets vs Apps

- **Applets**: Data objects that live inside projects. Good for development and testing.
- **Apps**: Versioned, shareable executables that don't live inside projects. Can be published for others to use.

Both are created identically until the final build step. Applets can be converted to apps later.

## Creating an App/Applet

### Using dx-app-wizard

Generate a skeleton app directory structure:

```bash
dx-app-wizard
```

This creates:
- `dxapp.json` - Configuration file
- `src/` - Source code directory
- `resources/` - Bundled dependencies
- `test/` - Test files

### Building and Deploying

Build an applet:
```bash
dx build
```

Build an app:
```bash
dx build --app
```

The build process:
1. Validates dxapp.json configuration
2. Bundles source code and resources
3. Deploys to the platform
4. Returns the applet/app ID

## App Directory Structure

```
my-app/
├── dxapp.json          # Metadata and configuration
├── src/
│   └── my-app.py       # Main executable (Python)
│   └── my-app.sh       # Or Bash script
├── resources/          # Bundled files and dependencies
│   └── tools/
│   └── data/
└── test/               # Test data and scripts
    └── test.json
```

## Python App Structure

### Entry Points

Python apps use the `@dxpy.entry_point()` decorator to define functions:

```python
import dxpy

@dxpy.entry_point('main')
def main(input1, input2):
    # Process inputs
    # Return outputs
    return {
        "output1": result1,
        "output2": result2
    }

dxpy.run()
```

### Input/Output Handling

**Inputs**: DNAnexus data objects are represented as dicts containing links:

```python
@dxpy.entry_point('main')
def main(reads_file):
    # Convert link to handler
    reads_dxfile = dxpy.DXFile(reads_file)

    # Download to local filesystem
    dxpy.download_dxfile(reads_dxfile.get_id(), "reads.fastq")

    # Process file...
```

**Outputs**: Return primitive types directly, convert file outputs to links:

```python
    # Upload result file
    output_file = dxpy.upload_local_file("output.fastq")

    return {
        "trimmed_reads": dxpy.dxlink(output_file)
    }
```

## Bash App Structure

Bash apps use a simpler shell script approach:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e -x -o pipefail

main() {
    # Download inputs
    dx download "$reads_file" -o reads.fastq

    # Process
    process_reads reads.fastq > output.fastq

    # Upload outputs
    trimmed_reads=$(dx upload output.fastq --brief)

    # Set job output
    dx-jobutil-add-output trimmed_reads "$trimmed_reads" --class=file
}
```

## Common Development Patterns

### 1. Bioinformatics Pipeline

Download → Process → Upload pattern:

```python
# Download input
dxpy.download_dxfile(input_file_id, "input.fastq")

# Run analysis
subprocess.check_call(["tool", "input.fastq", "output.bam"])

# Upload result
output = dxpy.upload_local_file("output.bam")
return {"aligned_reads": dxpy.dxlink(output)}
```

### 2. Multi-file Processing

```python
# Process multiple inputs
for file_link in input_files:
    file_handler = dxpy.DXFile(file_link)
    local_path = f"{file_handler.name}"
    dxpy.download_dxfile(file_handler.get_id(), local_path)
    # Process each file...
```

### 3. Parallel Processing

Apps can spawn subjobs for parallel execution:

```python
# Create subjobs
subjobs = []
for item in input_list:
    subjob = dxpy.new_dxjob(
        fn_input={"input": item},
        fn_name="process_item"
    )
    subjobs.append(subjob)

# Collect results
results = [job.get_output_ref("result") for job in subjobs]
```

## Execution Environment

Apps run in isolated Linux VMs (Ubuntu 24.04) with:
- Internet access
- DNAnexus API access
- Temporary scratch space in `/home/dnanexus`
- Input files downloaded to job workspace
- Root access for installing dependencies

## Testing Apps

### Local Testing

Test app logic locally before deploying:

```bash
cd my-app
python src/my-app.py
```

### Platform Testing

Run the applet on the platform:

```bash
dx run applet-xxxx -i input1=file-yyyy
```

Monitor job execution:

```bash
dx watch job-zzzz
```

View job logs:

```bash
dx watch job-zzzz --get-streams
```

## Best Practices

1. **Error Handling**: Use try-except blocks and provide informative error messages
2. **Logging**: Print progress and debug information to stdout/stderr
3. **Validation**: Validate inputs before processing
4. **Cleanup**: Remove temporary files when done
5. **Documentation**: Include clear descriptions in dxapp.json
6. **Testing**: Test with various input types and edge cases
7. **Versioning**: Use semantic versioning for apps

## Common Issues

### File Not Found
Ensure files are properly downloaded before accessing:
```python
dxpy.download_dxfile(file_id, local_path)
# Now safe to open local_path
```

### Out of Memory
Specify larger instance type in dxapp.json systemRequirements

### Timeout
Increase timeout in dxapp.json or split into smaller jobs

### Permission Errors
Ensure app has necessary permissions in dxapp.json
