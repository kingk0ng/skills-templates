- Reference sequence retrieval and validation

## Installation

### Python Installation

Install gtars Python bindings:

```bash
uv uv pip install gtars
```

### CLI Installation

Install command-line tools (requires Rust/Cargo):

```bash
# Install with all features
cargo install gtars-cli --features "uniwig overlaprs igd bbcache scoring fragsplit"

# Or install specific features only
cargo install gtars-cli --features "uniwig overlaprs"
```

### Rust Library

Add to Cargo.toml for Rust projects:

```toml
[dependencies]
gtars = { version = "0.1", features = ["tokenizers", "overlaprs"] }
```

## Core Capabilities

Gtars is organized into specialized modules, each focused on specific genomic analysis tasks:

### 1. Overlap Detection and IGD Indexing

Efficiently detect overlaps between genomic intervals using the Integrated Genome Database (IGD) data structure.

**When to use:**
- Finding overlapping regulatory elements
- Variant annotation
- Comparing ChIP-seq peaks
- Identifying shared genomic features

**Quick example:**
```python
import gtars

# Build IGD index and query overlaps
igd = gtars.igd.build_index("regions.bed")
overlaps = igd.query("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

See `references/overlap.md` for comprehensive overlap detection documentation.

### 2. Coverage Track Generation

Generate coverage tracks from sequencing data with the uniwig module.

**When to use:**
- ATAC-seq accessibility profiles
- ChIP-seq coverage visualization
- RNA-seq read coverage
- Differential coverage analysis

**Quick example:**
```bash
# Generate BigWig coverage track
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output coverage.bw --format bigwig
```

See `references/coverage.md` for detailed coverage analysis workflows.

### 3. Genomic Tokenization

Convert genomic regions into discrete tokens for machine learning applications, particularly for deep learning models on genomic data.

**When to use:**
- Preprocessing for genomic ML models
- Integration with geniml library
- Creating position encodings
- Training transformer models on genomic sequences

**Quick example:**
```python
from gtars.tokenizers import TreeTokenizer

tokenizer = TreeTokenizer.from_bed_file("training_regions.bed")
token = tokenizer.tokenize("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

See `references/tokenizers.md` for tokenization documentation.

### 4. Reference Sequence Management

Handle reference genome sequences and compute digests following the GA4GH refget protocol.

**When to use:**
- Validating reference genome integrity
- Extracting specific genomic sequences
- Computing sequence digests
- Cross-reference comparisons

**Quick example:**
```python
# Load reference and extract sequences
store = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("hg38.fa")
sequence = store.get_subsequence("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

See `references/refget.md` for reference sequence operations.

### 5. Fragment Processing

Split and analyze fragment files, particularly useful for single-cell genomics data.

**When to use:**
- Processing single-cell ATAC-seq data
- Splitting fragments by cell barcodes
- Cluster-based fragment analysis
- Fragment quality control

**Quick example:**
```bash
# Split fragments by clusters
gtars fragsplit cluster-split --input fragments.tsv --clusters clusters.txt --output-dir ./by_cluster/
```

See `references/cli.md` for fragment processing commands.

### 6. Fragment Scoring

Score fragment overlaps against reference datasets.

**When to use:**
- Evaluating fragment enrichment
- Comparing experimental data to references
- Quality metrics computation
- Batch scoring across samples

**Quick example:**
```bash
# Score fragments against reference
gtars scoring score --fragments fragments.bed --reference reference.bed --output scores.txt
```

## Common Workflows

Identify overlapping genomic features:

```python
import gtars

# Load two region sets
peaks = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("chip_peaks.bed")
promoters = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("promoters.bed")

# Find overlaps
overlapping_peaks = peaks.filter_overlapping(promoters)

# Export results
overlapping_peaks.to_bed("peaks_in_promoters.bed")
```

### Workflow 2: Coverage Track Pipeline

Generate coverage tracks for visualization:

```bash
# Step 1: Generate coverage
gtars uniwig generate --input atac_fragments.bed --output coverage.wig --resolution 10

# Step 2: Convert to BigWig for genome browsers
gtars uniwig generate --input atac_fragments.bed --output coverage.bw --format bigwig
```

### Workflow 3: ML Preprocessing

Prepare genomic data for machine learning:

```python
from gtars.tokenizers import TreeTokenizer
import gtars

# Step 1: Load training regions
regions = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("training_peaks.bed")

# Step 2: Create tokenizer
tokenizer = TreeTokenizer.from_bed_file("training_peaks.bed")

# Step 3: Tokenize regions
tokens = [tokenizer.tokenize(r.chromosome, r.start, r.end) for r in regions]

# Step 4: Use tokens in ML pipeline
# (integrate with geniml or custom models)
```

## 📚 Reference Materials


### Coverage

# Coverage Analysis with Uniwig

The uniwig module generates coverage tracks from sequencing data, providing efficient conversion of genomic intervals to coverage profiles.

## Coverage Track Generation

Create coverage tracks from BED files:

```python
import gtars

# Generate coverage from BED file
coverage = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("fragments.bed")

# Generate coverage with specific resolution
coverage = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("fragments.bed", resolution=10)

# Generate strand-specific coverage
fwd_coverage = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("fragments.bed", strand="+")
rev_coverage = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("fragments.bed", strand="-")
```

## CLI Usage

Generate coverage tracks from command line:

```bash
# Generate coverage track
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output coverage.wig

# Specify resolution
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output coverage.wig --resolution 10

# Generate BigWig format
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output coverage.bw --format bigwig

# Strand-specific coverage
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output forward.wig --strand +
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output reverse.wig --strand -
```

## Working with Coverage Data

### Accessing Coverage Values

Query coverage at specific positions:

```python
# Get coverage at position
cov = coverage.get_coverage("chr1", 1000)

# Get coverage over range
cov_array = coverage.get_coverage_range("chr1", 1000, 2000)

# Get coverage statistics
mean_cov = coverage.mean_coverage("chr1", 1000, 2000)
max_cov = coverage.max_coverage("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

### Coverage Operations

Perform operations on coverage tracks:

```python
# Normalize coverage
normalized = coverage.normalize()

# Smooth coverage
smoothed = coverage.smooth(window_size=10)

# Combine coverage tracks
combined = coverage1.add(coverage2)

# Compute coverage difference
diff = coverage1.subtract(coverage2)
```

## Output Formats

Uniwig supports multiple output formats:

### WIG Format

Standard wiggle format:
```
fixedStep chrom=chr1 start=1000 step=1
12
15
18
22
...
```

### BigWig Format

Binary format for efficient storage and access:
```bash
# Generate BigWig
gtars uniwig generate --input fragments.bed --output coverage.bw --format bigwig
```

### BedGraph Format

Flexible format for variable coverage:
```
chr1    1000    1001    12
chr1    1001    1002    15
chr1    1002    1003    18
```

## Use Cases

### ATAC-seq Analysis

Generate chromatin accessibility profiles:

```python
# Generate ATAC-seq coverage
atac_fragments = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("atac_fragments.bed")
coverage = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("atac_fragments.bed", resolution=1)

# Identify accessible regions
peaks = coverage.call_peaks(threshold=10)
```

### ChIP-seq Peak Visualization

Create coverage tracks for ChIP-seq data:

```bash
# Generate coverage for visualization
gtars uniwig generate --input chip_seq_fragments.bed \
                      --output chip_coverage.bw \
                      --format bigwig
```

### RNA-seq Coverage

Compute read coverage for RNA-seq:

```python
# Generate strand-specific RNA-seq coverage
fwd = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("rnaseq.bed", strand="+")
rev = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("rnaseq.bed", strand="-")

# Export for IGV
fwd.to_bigwig("rnaseq_fwd.bw")
rev.to_bigwig("rnaseq_rev.bw")
```

### Differential Coverage Analysis

Compare coverage between samples:

```python
# Generate coverage for two samples
control = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("control.bed")
treatment = gtars.uniwig.coverage_from_bed("treatment.bed")

# Compute fold change
fold_change = treatment.divide(control)

# Find differential regions
diff_regions = fold_change.find_regions(threshold=2.0)
```

## Performance Optimization

- Use appropriate resolution for data scale
- BigWig format recommended for large datasets
- Parallel processing available for multiple chromosomes
- Memory-efficient streaming for large files




### Refget

# Reference Sequence Management

The refget module handles reference sequence retrieval and digest computation, following the refget protocol for sequence identification.

## RefgetStore

RefgetStore manages reference sequences and their digests:

```python
import gtars

# Create RefgetStore
store = gtars.RefgetStore()

# Add sequence
store.add_sequence("chr1", sequence_data)

# Retrieve sequence
seq = store.get_sequence("chr1")

# Get sequence digest
digest = store.get_digest("chr1")
```

## Sequence Digests

Compute and verify sequence digests:

```python
# Compute digest for sequence
from gtars.refget import compute_digest

digest = compute_digest(sequence_data)

# Verify digest matches
is_valid = store.verify_digest("chr1", expected_digest)
```

## Integration with Reference Genomes

Work with standard reference genomes:

```python
# Load reference genome
store = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("hg38.fa")

# Get chromosome sequences
chr1 = store.get_sequence("chr1")
chr2 = store.get_sequence("chr2")

# Get subsequence
region_seq = store.get_subsequence("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

## CLI Usage

Manage reference sequences from command line:

```bash
# Compute digest for FASTA file
gtars refget digest --input genome.fa --output digests.txt

# Verify sequence digest
gtars refget verify --sequence sequence.fa --digest expected_digest
```

## Refget Protocol Compliance

The refget module follows the GA4GH refget protocol:

### Digest Computation

Digests are computed using SHA-512 truncated to 48 bytes:

```python
# Compute refget-compliant digest
digest = gtars.refget.compute_digest(sequence)
# Returns: "SQ.abc123..."
```

### Sequence Retrieval

Retrieve sequences by digest:

```python
# Get sequence by refget digest
seq = store.get_sequence_by_digest("SQ.abc123...")
```

## Use Cases

### Reference Validation

Verify reference genome integrity:

```python
# Compute digests for reference
store = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("reference.fa")
digests = {chrom: store.get_digest(chrom) for chrom in store.chromosomes}

# Compare with expected digests
for chrom, expected in expected_digests.items():
    actual = digests[chrom]
    if actual != expected:
        print(f"Mismatch for {chrom}: {actual} != {expected}")
```

### Sequence Extraction

Extract specific genomic regions:

```python
# Extract regions of interest
store = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("hg38.fa")

regions = [
    ("chr1", 1000, 2000),
    ("chr2", 5000, 6000),
    ("chr3", 10000, 11000)
]

sequences = [store.get_subsequence(c, s, e) for c, s, e in regions]
```

### Cross-Reference Comparison

Compare sequences across different references:

```python
# Load two reference versions
hg19 = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("hg19.fa")
hg38 = gtars.RefgetStore.from_fasta("hg38.fa")

# Compare digests
for chrom in hg19.chromosomes:
    digest_19 = hg19.get_digest(chrom)
    digest_38 = hg38.get_digest(chrom)
    if digest_19 != digest_38:
        print(f"{chrom} differs between hg19 and hg38")
```

## Performance Notes

- Sequences loaded on demand
- Digests cached after computation
- Efficient subsequence extraction
- Memory-mapped file support for large genomes

### Overlap

# Overlap Detection and IGD

The overlaprs module provides efficient overlap detection between genomic intervals using the Integrated Genome Database (IGD) data structure.

## IGD Index

IGD (Integrated Genome Database) is a specialized data structure for fast genomic interval queries and overlap detection.

### Building an IGD Index

Create indexes from genomic region files:

```python
import gtars

# Build IGD index from BED file
igd = gtars.igd.build_index("regions.bed")

# Save index for reuse
igd.save("regions.igd")

# Load existing index
igd = gtars.igd.load_index("regions.igd")
```

### Querying Overlaps

Find overlapping regions efficiently:

```python
# Query a single region
overlaps = igd.query("chr1", 1000, 2000)

# Query multiple regions
results = []
for chrom, start, end in query_regions:
    overlaps = igd.query(chrom, start, end)
    results.append(overlaps)

# Get overlap counts only
count = igd.count_overlaps("chr1", 1000, 2000)
```

## CLI Usage

The overlaprs command-line tool provides overlap detection:

```bash
# Find overlaps between two BED files
gtars overlaprs query --index regions.bed --query query_regions.bed

# Count overlaps
gtars overlaprs count --index regions.bed --query query_regions.bed

# Output overlapping regions
gtars overlaprs overlap --index regions.bed --query query_regions.bed --output overlaps.bed
```

### IGD CLI Commands

Build and query IGD indexes:

```bash
# Build IGD index
gtars igd build --input regions.bed --output regions.igd

# Query IGD index
gtars igd query --index regions.igd --region "chr1:1000-2000"

# Batch query from file
gtars igd query --index regions.igd --query-file queries.bed --output results.bed
```

## Python API

### Overlap Detection

Compute overlaps between region sets:

```python
import gtars

# Load two region sets
set_a = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("regions_a.bed")
set_b = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("regions_b.bed")

# Find overlaps
overlaps = set_a.overlap(set_b)

# Get regions from A that overlap with B
overlapping_a = set_a.filter_overlapping(set_b)

# Get regions from A that don't overlap with B
non_overlapping_a = set_a.filter_non_overlapping(set_b)
```

### Overlap Statistics

Calculate overlap metrics:

```python
# Count overlaps
overlap_count = set_a.count_overlaps(set_b)

# Calculate overlap fraction
overlap_fraction = set_a.overlap_fraction(set_b)

# Get overlap coverage
coverage = set_a.overlap_coverage(set_b)
```

## Performance Characteristics

IGD provides efficient querying:
- **Index construction**: O(n log n) where n is number of regions
- **Query time**: O(k + log n) where k is number of overlaps
- **Memory efficient**: Compact representation of genomic intervals

## Use Cases

### Regulatory Element Analysis

Identify overlap between genomic features:

```python
# Find transcription factor binding sites overlapping promoters
tfbs = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("chip_seq_peaks.bed")
promoters = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("promoters.bed")

overlapping_tfbs = tfbs.filter_overlapping(promoters)
print(f"Found {len(overlapping_tfbs)} TFBS in promoters")
```

### Variant Annotation

Annotate variants with overlapping features:

```python
# Check which variants overlap with coding regions
variants = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("variants.bed")
cds = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("coding_sequences.bed")

coding_variants = variants.filter_overlapping(cds)
```

### Chromatin State Analysis

Compare chromatin states across samples:

```python
# Find regions with consistent chromatin states
sample1 = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("sample1_peaks.bed")
sample2 = gtars.RegionSet.from_bed("sample2_peaks.bed")

consistent_regions = sample1.overlap(sample2)
```




### Tokenizers

# Genomic Tokenizers

Tokenizers convert genomic regions into discrete tokens for machine learning applications, particularly useful for training genomic deep learning models.

## Python API

### Creating a Tokenizer

Load tokenizer configurations from various sources:

```python
import gtars

# From BED file
tokenizer = gtars.tokenizers.TreeTokenizer.from_bed_file("regions.bed")

# From configuration file
tokenizer = gtars.tokenizers.TreeTokenizer.from_config("tokenizer_config.yaml")

# From region string
tokenizer = gtars.tokenizers.TreeTokenizer.from_region_string("chr1:1000-2000")
```

### Tokenizing Genomic Regions

Convert genomic coordinates to tokens:

```python
# Tokenize a single region
token = tokenizer.tokenize("chr1", 1000, 2000)

# Tokenize multiple regions
tokens = []
for chrom, start, end in regions:
    token = tokenizer.tokenize(chrom, start, end)
    tokens.append(token)
```

### Token Properties

Access token information:

```python
# Get token ID
token_id = token.id

# Get genomic coordinates
chrom = token.chromosome
start = token.start
end = token.end

# Get token metadata
metadata = token.metadata
```

## Use Cases

### Machine Learning Preprocessing

Tokenizers are essential for preparing genomic data for ML models:

1. **Sequence modeling**: Convert genomic intervals into discrete tokens for transformer models
2. **Position encoding**: Create consistent positional encodings across datasets
3. **Data augmentation**: Generate alternative tokenizations for training

### Integration with geniml

The tokenizers module integrates seamlessly with the geniml library for genomic ML:

```python
# Tokenize regions for geniml
from gtars.tokenizers import TreeTokenizer
import geniml

tokenizer = TreeTokenizer.from_bed_file("training_regions.bed")
tokens = [tokenizer.tokenize(r.chrom, r.start, r.end) for r in regions]

# Use tokens in geniml models
model = geniml.Model(vocab_size=tokenizer.vocab_size)
```

## Configuration Format

Tokenizer configuration files support YAML format:

```yaml
# tokenizer_config.yaml
type: tree
resolution: 1000  # Token resolution in base pairs
chromosomes:
  - chr1
  - chr2
  - chr3
options:
  overlap_handling: merge
  gap_threshold: 100
```

## Performance Considerations

- TreeTokenizer uses efficient data structures for fast tokenization
- Batch tokenization is recommended for large datasets
- Pre-loading tokenizers reduces overhead for repeated operations
