# perplexity-search

> Perform AI-powered web searches with real-time information using Perplexity models via LiteLLM and OpenRouter. This skill should be used when conducting web searches for current information, finding recent scientific literature, getting grounded answers with source citations, or accessing information beyond the model's knowledge cutoff. Provides access to multiple Perplexity models including Sonar Pro, Sonar Pro Search (advanced agentic search), and Sonar Reasoning Pro through a single OpenRouter API key.

# Perplexity Search

## Overview

Perform AI-powered web searches using Perplexity models through LiteLLM and OpenRouter. Perplexity provides real-time, web-grounded answers with source citations, making it ideal for finding current information, recent scientific literature, and facts beyond the model's training data cutoff.

This skill provides access to all Perplexity models through OpenRouter, requiring only a single API key (no separate Perplexity account needed).

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when:
- Searching for current information or recent developments (2024 and beyond)
- Finding latest scientific publications and research
- Getting real-time answers grounded in web sources
- Verifying facts with source citations
- Conducting literature searches across multiple domains
- Accessing information beyond the model's knowledge cutoff
- Performing domain-specific research (biomedical, technical, clinical)
- Comparing current approaches or technologies

**Do not use** for:
- Simple calculations or logic problems (use directly)
- Tasks requiring code execution (use standard tools)
- Questions well within the model's training data (unless verification needed)

## Quick Start

### Setup (One-time)

1. **Get OpenRouter API key**:
   - Visit https://openrouter.ai/keys
   - Create account and generate API key
   - Add credits to account (minimum $5 recommended)

2. **Configure environment**:
   ```bash
   # Set API key
   export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-v1-your-key-here'

   # Or use setup script
   python scripts/setup_env.py --api-key sk-or-v1-your-key-here
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv pip install litellm
   ```

4. **Verify setup**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/perplexity_search.py --check-setup
   ```

See `references/openrouter_setup.md` for detailed setup instructions, troubleshooting, and security best practices.

### Basic Usage

**Simple search:**
```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py "What are the latest developments in CRISPR gene editing?"
```

**Save results:**
```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py "Recent CAR-T therapy clinical trials" --output results.json
```

**Use specific model:**
```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py "Compare mRNA and viral vector vaccines" --model sonar-pro-search
```

**Verbose output:**
```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py "Quantum computing for drug discovery" --verbose
```

## Available Models

Access models via `--model` parameter:

- **sonar-pro** (default): General-purpose search, best balance of cost and quality
- **sonar-pro-search**: Most advanced agentic search with multi-step reasoning
- **sonar**: Basic model, most cost-effective for simple queries
- **sonar-reasoning-pro**: Advanced reasoning with step-by-step analysis
- **sonar-reasoning**: Basic reasoning capabilities

**Model selection guide:**
- Default queries → `sonar-pro`
- Complex multi-step analysis → `sonar-pro-search`
- Explicit reasoning needed → `sonar-reasoning-pro`
- Simple fact lookups → `sonar`
- Cost-sensitive bulk queries → `sonar`

See `references/model_comparison.md` for detailed comparison, use cases, pricing, and performance characteristics.

## Crafting Effective Queries

### Be Specific and Detailed

**Good examples:**
- "What are the latest clinical trial results for CAR-T cell therapy in treating B-cell lymphoma published in 2024?"
- "Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of mRNA vaccines versus viral vector vaccines for COVID-19"
- "Explain AlphaFold3 improvements over AlphaFold2 with specific accuracy metrics from 2023-2024 research"

**Bad examples:**
- "Tell me about cancer treatment" (too broad)
- "CRISPR" (too vague)
- "vaccines" (lacks specificity)

### Include Time Constraints

Perplexity searches real-time web data:
- "What papers were published in Nature Medicine in 2024 about long COVID?"
- "What are the latest developments (past 6 months) in large language model efficiency?"
- "What was announced at NeurIPS 2023 regarding AI safety?"

### Specify Domain and Sources

For high-quality results, mention source preferences:
- "According to peer-reviewed publications in high-impact journals..."
- "Based on FDA-approved treatments..."
- "From clinical trial registries like clinicaltrials.gov..."

### Structure Complex Queries

Break complex questions into clear components:
1. **Topic**: Main subject
2. **Scope**: Specific aspect of interest
3. **Context**: Time frame, domain, constraints
4. **Output**: Desired format or type of answer

**Example:**
"What improvements does AlphaFold3 offer over AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, according to research published between 2023 and 2024? Include specific accuracy metrics and benchmarks."

See `references/search_strategies.md` for comprehensive guidance on query design, domain-specific patterns, and advanced techniques.

## Common Use Cases

### Scientific Literature Search

```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py \
  "What does recent research (2023-2024) say about the role of gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease? Focus on peer-reviewed studies and include specific bacterial species identified." \
  --model sonar-pro
```

### Technical Documentation

```bash
python scripts/perplexity_search.py \
  "How to implement real-time data streaming from Kafka to PostgreSQL using Python? Include considerations for handling backpressure and ensuring exactly-once semantics." \

```

## Working with Results

### Programmatic Access

Use `perplexity_search.py` as a module:

```python
from scripts.perplexity_search import search_with_perplexity

result = search_with_perplexity(
    query="What are the latest CRISPR developments?",
    model="openrouter/perplexity/sonar-pro",
    max_tokens=4000,
    temperature=0.2,
    verbose=False
)

if result["success"]:
    print(result["answer"])
    print(f"Tokens used: {result['usage']['total_tokens']}")
else:
    print(f"Error: {result['error']}")
```

### Save and Process Results

```bash
# Save to JSON
python scripts/perplexity_search.py "query" --output results.json

# Process with jq
cat results.json | jq '.answer'
cat results.json | jq '.usage'
```

### Batch Processing

Create a script for multiple queries:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
queries=(
  "CRISPR developments 2024"
  "mRNA vaccine technology advances"
  "AlphaFold3 accuracy improvements"
)

for query in "${queries[@]}"; do
  echo "Searching: $query"
  python scripts/perplexity_search.py "$query" --output "results_$(echo $query | tr ' ' '_').json"
  sleep 2  # Rate limiting
done
```

## Cost Management

Perplexity models have different pricing tiers:

**Approximate costs per query:**
- Sonar: $0.001-0.002 (most cost-effective)
- Sonar Pro: $0.002-0.005 (recommended default)
- Sonar Reasoning Pro: $0.005-0.010
- Sonar Pro Search: $0.020-0.050+ (most comprehensive)

**Cost optimization strategies:**
1. Use `sonar` for simple fact lookups
2. Default to `sonar-pro` for most queries
3. Reserve `sonar-pro-search` for complex analysis
4. Set `--max-tokens` to limit response length
5. Monitor usage at https://openrouter.ai/activity
6. Set spending limits in OpenRouter dashboard

### Step 4: Configure Environment

You have two options for setting up your API key:

#### Option A: Environment Variable (Recommended)

**Linux/macOS:**
```bash
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='sk-or-v1-your-key-here'
```

To make it permanent, add to your shell profile:
```bash
# For bash: Add to ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key-here"' >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc

# For zsh: Add to ~/.zshrc
echo 'export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:OPENROUTER_API_KEY = "sk-or-v1-your-key-here"
```

To make it permanent:
```powershell
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable('OPENROUTER_API_KEY', 'sk-or-v1-your-key-here', 'User')
```

#### Option B: .env File

Create a `.env` file in your project directory:

```bash
# Create .env file
cat > .env << EOF
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-your-key-here
EOF
```

Or use the setup script:
```bash
python scripts/setup_env.py --api-key sk-or-v1-your-key-here
```

Then load it before running scripts:
```bash
# Load environment variables from .env
source .env

# Or use python-dotenv
pip install python-dotenv
```

**Using python-dotenv in scripts:**
```python
from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv()  # Loads .env file automatically

import os
api_key = os.environ.get("OPENROUTER_API_KEY")
```

### Search_Strategies

# Search Strategies for Perplexity

Best practices and strategies for crafting effective search queries with Perplexity models.

## Query Design Principles

### Be Specific and Detailed

Better results come from specific, well-structured queries rather than broad questions.

**Good examples:**
- "What are the latest clinical trial results for CAR-T cell therapy in treating B-cell lymphoma published in 2024?"
- "Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of mRNA vaccines versus viral vector vaccines for COVID-19"
- "Explain the mechanism of CRISPR-Cas9 off-target effects and current mitigation strategies"

**Bad examples:**
- "Tell me about cancer treatment" (too broad)
- "CRISPR" (too vague)
- "vaccines" (lacks specificity)

### Structure Complex Queries

Break complex questions into clear components:

1. **Topic**: What is the main subject?
2. **Scope**: What specific aspect are you interested in?
3. **Context**: What time frame, domain, or constraints apply?
4. **Output**: What format or type of answer do you need?

**Example:**
```
Topic: Protein folding prediction
Scope: AlphaFold3 improvements over AlphaFold2
Context: Published research from 2023-2024
Output: Technical comparison with specific accuracy metrics
```

**Query:**
"What improvements does AlphaFold3 offer over AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction, according to research published between 2023 and 2024? Include specific accuracy metrics and benchmarks."

## Domain-Specific Search Patterns

### Scientific Literature Search

For scientific queries, include:
- Specific terminology and concepts
- Time constraints (recent publications)
- Methodology or study types of interest
- Journal quality or domain constraints

**Template:**
"What does recent research (2023-2024) say about [specific scientific concept] in [domain]? Focus on [peer-reviewed/preprint] studies and include [specific metrics/findings]."

**Example:**
"What does recent research (2023-2024) say about the role of gut microbiome in Parkinson's disease? Focus on peer-reviewed studies and include specific bacterial species identified."

### Technical/Engineering Search

For technical queries, specify:
- Technology stack or framework
- Use case or application context
- Version requirements
- Performance or implementation constraints

**Template:**
"How to [specific technical task] using [technology/framework] for [use case]? Include [implementation details/performance considerations]."

**Example:**
"How to implement real-time data streaming from Kafka to PostgreSQL using Python? Include considerations for handling backpressure and ensuring exactly-once semantics."

### Medical/Clinical Search

For medical queries, include:
- Specific conditions, treatments, or interventions
- Patient population or demographics
- Outcomes of interest
- Evidence level (RCTs, meta-analyses, etc.)

**Template:**
"What is the evidence for [intervention] in treating [condition] in [population]? Focus on [study types] and report [specific outcomes]."

**Example:**
"What is the evidence for intermittent fasting in managing type 2 diabetes in adults? Focus on randomized controlled trials and report HbA1c changes and weight loss outcomes."

## Advanced Query Techniques

### Comparative Analysis

For comparing multiple options:

**Template:**
"Compare [option A] versus [option B] for [use case] in terms of [criteria 1], [criteria 2], and [criteria 3]. Include [specific evidence or metrics]."

**Example:**
"Compare PyTorch versus TensorFlow for implementing transformer models in terms of ease of use, performance, and ecosystem support. Include benchmarks from recent studies."

### Trend Analysis

For understanding trends over time:

**Template:**
"What are the key trends in [domain/topic] over the past [time period]? Highlight [specific aspects] and include [data or examples]."

**Example:**
"What are the key trends in single-cell RNA sequencing technology over the past 5 years? Highlight improvements in throughput, cost, and resolution, with specific examples."

### Gap Identification

For finding research or knowledge gaps:

**Template:**
"What are the current limitations and open questions in [field/topic]? Focus on [specific aspects] and identify areas needing further research."

**Example:**
"What are the current limitations and open questions in quantum error correction? Focus on practical implementations and identify scalability challenges."

### Mechanism Explanation

For understanding how things work:

**Template:**
"Explain the mechanism by which [process/phenomenon] occurs in [context]. Include [level of detail] and discuss [specific aspects]."

**Example:**
"Explain the mechanism by which mRNA vaccines induce immune responses. Include molecular details of translation, antigen presentation, and memory cell formation."

## Query Refinement Strategies

### Start Broad, Then Narrow

1. **Initial query**: "Recent developments in cancer immunotherapy"
2. **Refined query**: "Recent developments in checkpoint inhibitor combination therapies for melanoma"
3. **Specific query**: "What are the clinical trial results for combining anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma patients, published 2023-2024?"

### Add Constraints Iteratively

Start with core query, then add constraints:

1. **Base**: "Machine learning for drug discovery"
2. **Add domain**: "Machine learning for small molecule drug discovery"
3. **Add method**: "Deep learning approaches for small molecule property prediction"
4. **Add context**: "Recent deep learning approaches (2023-2024) for predicting ADMET properties of small molecules, including accuracy benchmarks"

### Specify Desired Output Format

Improve answers by specifying the output format:

- "Provide a step-by-step explanation..."
- "Summarize in bullet points..."
- "Create a comparison table of..."
- "List the top 5 approaches with pros and cons..."
- "Include specific numerical benchmarks and metrics..."

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### Too Vague

**Problem**: "Tell me about AI"
**Solution**: "What are the current state-of-the-art approaches for few-shot learning in computer vision as of 2024?"

### Loaded Questions

**Problem**: "Why is drug X better than drug Y?"
**Solution**: "Compare the efficacy and safety profiles of drug X versus drug Y based on clinical trial evidence."

### Multiple Unrelated Questions

**Problem**: "What is CRISPR and how do vaccines work and what causes cancer?"
**Solution**: Ask separate queries for each topic.

### Assumed Knowledge Without Context

**Problem**: "What are the latest results?" (Latest results for what?)
**Solution**: "What are the latest clinical trial results for CAR-T cell therapy in treating acute lymphoblastic leukemia?"

## Domain-Specific Keywords

### Biomedical Research

Use precise terminology:
- "randomized controlled trial" instead of "study"
- "meta-analysis" instead of "review"
- "in vitro" vs "in vivo" vs "clinical"
- "peer-reviewed" for quality filter
- Specific gene/protein names (e.g., "BRCA1" not "breast cancer gene")

### Computational/AI Research

Use technical terms:
- "transformer architecture" not "AI model"
- "few-shot learning" not "learning from limited data"
- "zero-shot" vs "few-shot" vs "fine-tuning"
- Specific model names (e.g., "GPT-4" not "language model")

### Chemistry/Drug Discovery

Use IUPAC names and specific terms:
- "small molecule" vs "biologic"
- "pharmacokinetics" (ADME) vs "pharmacodynamics"
- Specific assay types (e.g., "IC50", "EC50")
- Drug names (generic vs brand)

## Time-Constrained Searches

Perplexity searches real-time web data, making time constraints valuable:

**Templates:**
- "What papers were published in [journal] in [month/year] about [topic]?"
- "What are the latest developments (past 6 months) in [field]?"
- "What was announced at [conference] [year] regarding [topic]?"
- "What are the most recent clinical trial results (2024) for [treatment]?"

**Examples:**
- "What papers were published in Nature Medicine in January 2024 about long COVID?"
- "What are the latest developments (past 6 months) in large language model training efficiency?"
- "What was announced at NeurIPS 2023 regarding AI safety and alignment?"

## Source Quality Considerations

For high-quality results, mention source preferences:

- "According to peer-reviewed publications..."
- "Based on clinical trial registries like clinicaltrials.gov..."
- "From authoritative sources such as Nature, Science, Cell..."
- "According to FDA/EMA approvals..."
- "Based on systematic reviews or meta-analyses..."

**Example:**
"What is the current understanding of microplastics' impact on human health according to peer-reviewed research published in high-impact journals since 2022?"

## Iterative Search Workflow

For comprehensive research:

1. **Broad overview**: Get general understanding
2. **Specific deep-dives**: Focus on particular aspects
3. **Comparative analysis**: Compare approaches/methods
4. **Latest updates**: Find most recent developments
5. **Critical evaluation**: Identify limitations and gaps

**Example workflow for "CAR-T cell therapy":**

1. "What is CAR-T cell therapy and how does it work?"
2. "What are the specific molecular mechanisms by which CAR-T cells recognize and kill cancer cells?"
3. "Compare first-generation, second-generation, and third-generation CAR-T cell designs"
4. "What are the latest clinical trial results for CAR-T therapy in treating solid tumors (2024)?"
5. "What are the current limitations and challenges in CAR-T cell therapy, and what approaches are being investigated to address them?"

## Summary

Effective Perplexity searches require:
1. **Specificity**: Clear, detailed queries
2. **Structure**: Well-organized questions with context
3. **Terminology**: Domain-appropriate keywords
4. **Constraints**: Time frames, sources, output formats
5. **Iteration**: Refine based on initial results

The more specific and structured your query, the better and more relevant your results will be.
