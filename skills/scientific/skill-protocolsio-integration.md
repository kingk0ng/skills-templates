### Step 3: Implement Integration

Follow the guidance in the relevant reference files:

- Each reference includes detailed endpoint documentation
- API parameters and request/response formats are specified
- Common use cases and workflows are provided with examples
- Best practices and error handling guidance included

## Base URL and Request Format

All API requests use the base URL:
```
https://protocols.io/api/v3
```

All requests require the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

Most endpoints support JSON request/response format with `Content-Type: application/json`.

## Content Format Options

Many endpoints support a `content_format` parameter to control how protocol content is returned:

- `json`: Draft.js JSON format (default)
- `html`: HTML format
- `markdown`: Markdown format

Include as query parameter: `?content_format=html`

## Rate Limiting

Be aware of API rate limits:

- **Standard endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **PDF endpoint**: 5 requests/minute (signed-in), 3 requests/minute (unsigned)

Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors (HTTP 429).

## Python Request Examples

### Basic Protocol Search

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Search for CRISPR protocols
response = requests.get(
    "https://protocols.io/api/v3/protocols",
    headers=headers,
    params={
        "filter": "public",
        "key": "CRISPR",
        "page_size": 10,
        "content_format": "html"
    }
)

protocols = response.json()
for protocol in protocols["items"]:
    print(f"{protocol['title']} - {protocol['doi']}")
```

### Create New Protocol

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {
    "Authorization": f"Bearer {token}",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

# Create protocol
data = {
    "title": "CRISPR-Cas9 Gene Editing Protocol",
    "description": "Comprehensive protocol for CRISPR gene editing",
    "tags": ["CRISPR", "gene editing", "molecular biology"]
}

response = requests.post(
    "https://protocols.io/api/v3/protocols",
    headers=headers,
    json=data
)

protocol_id = response.json()["item"]["id"]
print(f"Created protocol: {protocol_id}")
```

### Upload File to Workspace

```python
import requests

token = "YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {token}"}

# Upload file
with open("data.csv", "rb") as f:
    files = {"file": f}
    data = {
        "folder_id": "root",
        "description": "Experimental results",
        "tags": "experiment,data,2025"
    }

    response = requests.post(
        "https://protocols.io/api/v3/workspaces/12345/files/upload",
        headers=headers,
        files=files,
        data=data
    )

file_id = response.json()["item"]["id"]
print(f"Uploaded file: {file_id}")
```

## Error Handling

Implement robust error handling for API requests:

```python
import requests
import time

def make_request_with_retry(url, headers, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.json()
            elif response.status_code == 429:  # Rate limit
                retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 60))
                time.sleep(retry_after)
                continue
            elif response.status_code >= 500:  # Server error
                time.sleep(2 ** attempt)  # Exponential backoff
                continue
            else:
                response.raise_for_status()

        except requests.exceptions.RequestException as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)

    raise Exception("Max retries exceeded")
```

### 1. Protocol Discovery and Import

Build a protocol discovery workflow:

```python
# Search for relevant protocols
response = requests.get(
    'https://protocols.io/api/v3/publications',
    headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'},
    params={'key': 'CRISPR', 'category': 'molecular-biology'}
)

# For each interesting protocol
for protocol in response.json()['items']:
    # Get full details
    details = requests.get(
        f'https://protocols.io/api/v3/protocols/{protocol["id"]}',
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}'}
    )
    # Import to local system
    import_protocol(details.json())
```

### 2. Experiment Tracking

Track all protocol executions:

1. Execute protocol in lab
2. Document execution: `POST /protocols/{id}/runs`
3. Upload result files to workspace
4. Link files in experiment record
5. Analyze success rates across runs

### 3. Notification System Integration

Build custom notification system:

1. Poll for new notifications: `GET /notifications?read=false`
2. Process each notification type
3. Send to internal communication system
4. Mark as read: `PATCH /notifications/{id}`

### 4. Profile Synchronization

Keep profiles synchronized across systems:

1. Retrieve profile: `GET /profile`
2. Compare with internal system
3. Update discrepancies
4. Sync profile images and metadata

## API Response Formats

### Standard Response Structure

Most API responses follow this structure:

```json
{
  "status_code": 0,
  "status_message": "Success",
  "item": { /* single item data */ },
  "items": [ /* array of items */ ],

## Common Use Cases

### 1. Import Existing Protocol

To import and work with an existing protocol:

1. Search for the protocol using keywords or DOI
2. Retrieve full protocol details with `/protocols/{protocol_id}`
3. Extract steps, materials, and metadata for local use

### 2. Create New Protocol from Scratch

To create a new protocol:

1. Create protocol with title and description: `POST /protocols`
2. Add steps sequentially: `POST /protocols/{id}/steps`
3. Review and test the protocol
4. Publish when ready: `POST /protocols/{id}/publish`

### 3. Update Published Protocol

To update an already-published protocol:

1. Retrieve current version: `GET /protocols/{protocol_id}`
2. Make necessary updates: `PATCH /protocols/{protocol_id}`
3. Update or add steps as needed
4. Publish new version: `POST /protocols/{protocol_id}/publish` with `publish_type: "update"`

### 4. Clone and Modify Protocol

To create a modified version of an existing protocol:

1. Retrieve original protocol details
2. Create new protocol with modified metadata
3. Copy and modify steps from original
4. Publish as new protocol

## Error Handling

Common error responses:

- `400 Bad Request`: Invalid parameters or request format
- `401 Unauthorized`: Missing or invalid access token
- `403 Forbidden`: Insufficient permissions for the operation
- `404 Not Found`: Protocol or resource not found
- `429 Too Many Requests`: Rate limit exceeded
- `500 Internal Server Error`: Server-side error

Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for `429` and `500` errors.




### Authentication

# Protocols.io Authentication

## Overview

The protocols.io API supports two types of access tokens for authentication, enabling access to both public and private content.

## Access Token Types

### 1. CLIENT_ACCESS_TOKEN

- **Purpose**: Enables access to public content and the private content of the client user
- **Use case**: When accessing your own protocols and public protocols
- **Scope**: Limited to the token owner's private content plus all public content

### 2. OAUTH_ACCESS_TOKEN

- **Purpose**: Grants access to specific users' private content plus all public content
- **Use case**: When building applications that need to access other users' content with their permission
- **Scope**: Full access to authorized user's private content plus all public content

## Authentication Header

All API requests must include an Authorization header:

```
Authorization: Bearer [ACCESS_TOKEN]
```

## OAuth Flow

### Step 1: Generate Authorization Link

Direct users to the authorization URL to grant access:

```
GET https://protocols.io/api/v3/oauth/authorize
```

**Parameters:**
- `client_id` (required): Your application's client ID
- `redirect_uri` (required): URL to redirect users after authorization
- `response_type` (required): Set to "code"
- `state` (optional but recommended): Random string to prevent CSRF attacks

**Example:**
```
https://protocols.io/api/v3/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID&redirect_uri=YOUR_REDIRECT_URI&response_type=code&state=RANDOM_STRING
```

### Step 2: Exchange Authorization Code for Token

After user authorization, protocols.io redirects to your `redirect_uri` with an authorization code. Exchange this code for an access token:

```
POST https://protocols.io/api/v3/oauth/token
```

**Parameters:**
- `grant_type`: Set to "authorization_code"
- `code`: The authorization code received
- `client_id`: Your application's client ID
- `client_secret`: Your application's client secret
- `redirect_uri`: Must match the redirect_uri used in Step 1

**Response includes:**
- `access_token`: The OAuth access token to use for API requests
- `token_type`: "Bearer"
- `expires_in`: Token lifetime in seconds (typically 1 year)
- `refresh_token`: Token for refreshing the access token

### Step 3: Refresh Access Token

Before the access token expires (typically 1 year), use the refresh token to obtain a new access token:

```
POST https://protocols.io/api/v3/oauth/token
```

**Parameters:**
- `grant_type`: Set to "refresh_token"
- `refresh_token`: The refresh token received in Step 2
- `client_id`: Your application's client ID
- `client_secret`: Your application's client secret

## Rate Limits

Be aware of rate limiting when making API requests:

- **Standard endpoints**: 100 requests per minute per user
- **PDF endpoint** (`/view/[protocol-uri].pdf`):
  - Signed-in users: 5 requests per minute
  - Unsigned users: 3 requests per minute

## Best Practices

1. **Store tokens securely**: Never expose access tokens in client-side code or version control
2. **Handle token expiration**: Implement automatic token refresh before expiration
3. **Respect rate limits**: Implement exponential backoff for rate limit errors
4. **Use state parameter**: Always include a state parameter in OAuth flow for security
5. **Validate redirect_uri**: Ensure redirect URIs match exactly between authorization and token requests
