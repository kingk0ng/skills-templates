   train, val, test = split_by_patient(dataset, [0.7, 0.1, 0.2])
   ```

2. **Check dataset statistics**: Understand your data before modeling
   ```python
   print(dataset.stats())  # Patients, visits, events, code distributions
   ```

3. **Use appropriate preprocessing**: Match processors to data types (see `references/preprocessing.md`)

### Model Development

   - Multi-class: macro-F1 (for imbalanced), weighted-F1
   - Multi-label: Jaccard, example-F1
   - Regression: MAE, RMSE

### Clinical Deployment

1. **Calibrate predictions**: Ensure probabilities are reliable (see `references/training_evaluation.md`)

2. **Assess fairness**: Evaluate across demographic groups to detect bias

3. **Quantify uncertainty**: Provide confidence estimates for predictions

4. **Interpret predictions**: Use attention weights, SHAP, or ChEFER for clinical trust

5. **Validate thoroughly**: Use held-out test sets from different time periods or sites

## Limitations and Considerations

### Data Requirements

- **Large datasets**: Deep learning models require sufficient data (thousands of patients)
- **Data quality**: Missing data and coding errors impact performance
- **Temporal consistency**: Ensure train/test split respects temporal ordering when needed

### Clinical Validation

- **External validation**: Test on data from different hospitals/systems
- **Prospective evaluation**: Validate in real clinical settings before deployment
- **Clinical review**: Have clinicians review predictions and interpretations
- **Ethical considerations**: Address privacy (HIPAA/GDPR), fairness, and safety

### Computational Resources

- **GPU recommended**: For training deep learning models efficiently
- **Memory requirements**: Large datasets may require 16GB+ RAM
- **Storage**: Healthcare datasets can be 10s-100s of GB

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError for dataset**:
- Ensure dataset files are downloaded and path is correct
- Check PyHealth version compatibility

**Out of memory**:
- Reduce batch size
- Reduce sequence length (`max_seq_length`)
- Use gradient accumulation
- Process data in chunks

**Poor performance**:
- Check class imbalance and use appropriate metrics (AUPRC vs AUROC)
- Verify preprocessing (normalization, missing data handling)
- Increase model capacity or training epochs
- Check for data leakage in train/test split

**Slow training**:
- Use GPU (`device="cuda"`)
- Increase batch size (if memory allows)

```

**3. Bidirectional Mapping**
```python
# Map in either direction
rxnorm_to_ndc = CrossMap.load("RXNORM", "NDC")
ndc_codes = rxnorm_to_ndc.map("197381")  # Get all NDC codes for RxNorm
```

## Workflow Examples

### Example 1: Standardize and Group Diagnoses
```python
from pyhealth.medcode import InnerMap, CrossMap

# Load maps
icd9_map = InnerMap.load("ICD9CM")
icd_to_ccs = CrossMap.load("ICD9CM", "CCSCM")

# Process diagnosis codes
raw_codes = ["4280", "428.0", "42800"]

standardized = [icd9_map.standardize(code) for code in raw_codes]
# All become "428.0"

ccs_categories = [icd_to_ccs.map(code)[0] for code in standardized]
# All map to CCS category "108" (Heart failure)
```

### Example 2: Drug Classification Analysis
```python
from pyhealth.medcode import CrossMap

# Map NDC to ATC for drug class analysis
ndc_to_atc = CrossMap.load("NDC", "ATC")

patient_drugs = ["00074-3799-13", "00074-7286-01", "00456-0765-01"]

# Get therapeutic subgroups (ATC level 2)
drug_classes = []
for ndc in patient_drugs:
    atc_codes = ndc_to_atc.map(ndc, level=2)
    if atc_codes:
        drug_classes.append(atc_codes[0])

# Analyze drug class distribution
```

### Example 3: ICD-9 to ICD-10 Migration
```python
from pyhealth.medcode import CrossMap

# Load ICD-9 to ICD-10 mapping
icd9_to_icd10 = CrossMap.load("ICD9CM", "ICD10CM")

# Convert historical ICD-9 codes
icd9_code = "428.0"
icd10_codes = icd9_to_icd10.map(icd9_code)
# Returns: ["I50.9", "I50.1", ...]  # Multiple possible ICD-10 codes

# Handle one-to-many mappings
for icd10_code in icd10_codes:
    print(f"ICD-9 {icd9_code} -> ICD-10 {icd10_code}")
```

## Integration with Datasets

Medical code translation integrates seamlessly with PyHealth datasets:

```python
from pyhealth.datasets import MIMIC4Dataset
from pyhealth.medcode import CrossMap

# Load dataset
dataset = MIMIC4Dataset(root="/path/to/data")

# Load code mapping
icd_to_ccs = CrossMap.load("ICD10CM", "CCSCM")

# Process patient diagnoses
for patient in dataset.iter_patients():
    for visit in patient.visits:
        diagnosis_events = [e for e in visit.events if e.vocabulary == "ICD10CM"]

        for event in diagnosis_events:
            ccs_codes = icd_to_ccs.map(event.code)
            print(f"Diagnosis {event.code} -> CCS {ccs_codes}")
```

## Use Cases

def custom_task_fn(patient):
    """Custom prediction task"""

    # Define input features
    samples = []

    for i, visit in enumerate(patient.visits):
        # Skip if not enough history
        if i < 2:
            continue

        # Create input from historical visits
        input_info = {
            "diagnoses": [],
            "medications": [],
            "procedures": []
        }

        # Collect features from previous visits
        for past_visit in patient.visits[:i]:
            for event in past_visit.events:
                if event.vocabulary == "ICD10CM":
                    input_info["diagnoses"].append(event.code)
                elif event.vocabulary == "NDC":
                    input_info["medications"].append(event.code)

        # Define prediction target
        # Example: predict specific outcome at current visit
        output_info = {
            "label": 1 if some_condition else 0
        }

        samples.append({
            "patient_id": patient.patient_id,
            "visit_id": visit.visit_id,
            "input_info": input_info,
            "output_info": output_info
        })

    return samples

# Apply custom task
sample_dataset = dataset.set_task(custom_task_fn)
```

### Task Function Components

1. **Input Schema Definition**
   - Specify which features to extract
   - Define feature types (codes, sequences, values)
   - Set temporal windows

2. **Output Schema Definition**
   - Define prediction targets
   - Set label types (binary, multi-class, multi-label, regression)
   - Specify evaluation metrics

3. **Filtering Logic**
   - Exclude patients/visits with insufficient data
   - Apply inclusion/exclusion criteria
   - Handle missing data

4. **Sample Generation**
   - Create input-output pairs
   - Maintain patient/visit identifiers
   - Preserve temporal ordering

## Task Selection Guidelines

### Clinical Prediction Tasks
**Use when:** Working with structured EHR data (diagnoses, medications, procedures)

**Datasets:** MIMIC-III, MIMIC-IV, eICU, OMOP

**Common tasks:**
- Mortality prediction for risk stratification
- Readmission prediction for care transition planning
- Length of stay for resource allocation
- Drug recommendation for clinical decision support

### Signal Processing Tasks

**Common tasks:**
- Sleep staging for sleep disorder diagnosis
- EEG abnormality detection for screening
- Seizure detection for epilepsy monitoring

### Imaging Tasks
**Use when:** Working with medical images

**Datasets:** COVID-19 CXR

**Common tasks:**
- Disease classification from radiographs
- Abnormality detection

### Text Tasks
**Use when:** Working with clinical notes and documentation

**Datasets:** Medical Transcriptions, MIMIC-III (with notes)

**Common tasks:**
- Medical coding from clinical text
- Specialty classification
- Clinical information extraction

## Task Output Structure

All task functions return `SampleDataset` with:

```python
sample = {
    "patient_id": "unique_patient_id",
    "visit_id": "unique_visit_id",  # if applicable
    "input_info": {
        # Input features (diagnoses, medications, etc.)
    },
    "output_info": {
        # Prediction targets (labels, values)
    }
}
```

## Integration with Models

Tasks define the input/output contract for models:

```python
from pyhealth.datasets import MIMIC4Dataset
from pyhealth.tasks import mortality_prediction_mimic4_fn
from pyhealth.models import Transformer

# 1. Create task-specific dataset
dataset = MIMIC4Dataset(root="/path/to/data")
sample_dataset = dataset.set_task(mortality_prediction_mimic4_fn)

# 2. Model automatically adapts to task schema
model = Transformer(
    dataset=sample_dataset,
    feature_keys=["diagnoses", "medications"],
    mode="binary",  # matches task output
)
```

## Best Practices

1. **Match task to clinical question**: Choose predefined tasks when available for standardized benchmarking

2. **Consider temporal windows**: Ensure sufficient history for meaningful predictions

3. **Handle class imbalance**: Many clinical outcomes are rare (mortality, readmission)

4. **Validate clinical relevance**: Ensure prediction windows align with clinical decision-making timelines

5. **Use appropriate metrics**: Different tasks require different evaluation metrics (AUROC for binary, macro-F1 for multi-class)

6. **Document exclusion criteria**: Track which patients/visits are filtered and why

7. **Preserve patient privacy**: Always use de-identified data and follow HIPAA/GDPR guidelines

## Calibration and Uncertainty Quantification

### Model Calibration

**Purpose:** Ensure predicted probabilities match actual frequencies

**Calibration Plot:**

    y_true, y_prob, n_bins=10
)

plt.plot(mean_predicted_value, fraction_of_positives, marker='o')
plt.plot([0, 1], [0, 1], linestyle='--', label='Perfect calibration')
plt.xlabel('Mean predicted probability')
plt.ylabel('Fraction of positives')
plt.legend()
```

**Expected Calibration Error (ECE):**
```python
def expected_calibration_error(y_true, y_prob, n_bins=10):
    """Compute ECE"""
    bins = np.linspace(0, 1, n_bins + 1)
    bin_indices = np.digitize(y_prob, bins) - 1

    ece = 0
    for i in range(n_bins):
        mask = bin_indices == i
        if mask.sum() > 0:
            bin_accuracy = y_true[mask].mean()
            bin_confidence = y_prob[mask].mean()
            ece += mask.sum() / len(y_true) * abs(bin_accuracy - bin_confidence)

    return ece
```

**Calibration Methods:**

1. **Platt Scaling**: Logistic regression on validation predictions
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

calibrator = LogisticRegression()
calibrator.fit(val_predictions.reshape(-1, 1), val_labels)
calibrated_probs = calibrator.predict_proba(test_predictions.reshape(-1, 1))[:, 1]
```

2. **Isotonic Regression**: Non-parametric calibration
```python
from sklearn.isotonic import IsotonicRegression

calibrator = IsotonicRegression(out_of_bounds='clip')
calibrator.fit(val_predictions, val_labels)
calibrated_probs = calibrator.predict(test_predictions)
```

3. **Temperature Scaling**: Scale logits before softmax
```python
def find_temperature(logits, labels):
    """Find optimal temperature parameter"""
    from scipy.optimize import minimize

    def nll(temp):
        scaled_logits = logits / temp
        probs = torch.softmax(scaled_logits, dim=1)
        return F.cross_entropy(probs, labels).item()

    result = minimize(nll, x0=1.0, method='BFGS')
    return result.x[0]

temperature = find_temperature(val_logits, val_labels)
calibrated_logits = test_logits / temperature
```

### Uncertainty Quantification

**Conformal Prediction:**

Provide prediction sets with guaranteed coverage.

**Usage:**
```python
from pyhealth.metrics import prediction_set_metrics_fn

# Calibrate on validation set
scores = 1 - val_predictions[np.arange(len(val_labels)), val_labels]
quantile_level = np.quantile(scores, 0.9)  # 90% coverage

# Generate prediction sets on test set
prediction_sets = test_predictions > (1 - quantile_level)

# Evaluate
metrics = prediction_set_metrics_fn(
    y_true=test_labels,
    prediction_sets=prediction_sets,
    metrics=["coverage", "average_size"]
)
```

**Monte Carlo Dropout:**

Estimate uncertainty through dropout at inference.

```python
def predict_with_uncertainty(model, dataloader, num_samples=20):
    """Predict with uncertainty using MC dropout"""
    model.train()  # Keep dropout active

    predictions = []
    for _ in range(num_samples):
        batch_preds = []
        for batch in dataloader:
            with torch.no_grad():
                output = model(batch)
                batch_preds.append(output)
        predictions.append(torch.cat(batch_preds))

    predictions = torch.stack(predictions)
    mean_pred = predictions.mean(dim=0)
    std_pred = predictions.std(dim=0)  # Uncertainty

    return mean_pred, std_pred
```

**Ensemble Uncertainty:**

```python
# Train multiple models
models = [train_model(seed=i) for i in range(5)]

# Predict with ensemble
ensemble_preds = []
for model in models:
    pred = model.predict(test_data)
    ensemble_preds.append(pred)

mean_pred = np.mean(ensemble_preds, axis=0)
std_pred = np.std(ensemble_preds, axis=0)  # Uncertainty
```

## Interpretability

### Attention Visualization

**For Transformer and RETAIN models:**

```python
# Get attention weights during inference
outputs = trainer.inference(
    test_loader,
    additional_outputs=["attention_weights"]
)

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

sample_idx = 0
sample_attention = attention[sample_idx]  # [seq_length, seq_length]

sns.heatmap(sample_attention, cmap='viridis')
plt.xlabel('Key Position')
plt.ylabel('Query Position')
plt.title('Attention Weights')
plt.show()
```

**RETAIN Interpretation:**

```python
# RETAIN provides visit-level and feature-level attention
visit_attention = outputs["visit_attention"]  # Which visits are important
feature_attention = outputs["feature_attention"]  # Which features are important

# Find most influential visit
most_important_visit = visit_attention[sample_idx].argmax()

# Find most influential features in that visit
important_features = feature_attention[sample_idx, most_important_visit].argsort()[-10:]
```

### Feature Importance

**Permutation Importance:**

```python
from sklearn.inspection import permutation_importance

def get_predictions(model, X):
    return model.predict(X)

result = permutation_importance(
    model, X_test, y_test,
    n_repeats=10,
    scoring='roc_auc'
)

# Sort features by importance
indices = result.importances_mean.argsort()[::-1]
for i in indices[:10]:
    print(f"{feature_names[i]}: {result.importances_mean[i]:.3f}")
```

**SHAP Values:**

```python
import shap

# Create explainer
explainer = shap.DeepExplainer(model, train_data)

## Common Preprocessing Workflows

### Workflow 1: EHR Mortality Prediction

```python
from pyhealth.data import (
    SequenceProcessor,
    BinaryLabelProcessor,
    SampleProcessor
)

# Define processors
input_processors = {
    "diagnoses": SequenceProcessor(max_seq_length=50),
    "medications": SequenceProcessor(max_seq_length=30),
    "procedures": SequenceProcessor(max_seq_length=20)
}

output_processor = BinaryLabelProcessor(class_weight="balanced")

# Combine into sample processor
sample_processor = SampleProcessor(
    input_processors=input_processors,
    output_processor=output_processor
)

# Process dataset
processed_samples = [sample_processor(s) for s in raw_samples]
```

### Workflow 2: Sleep Staging from EEG

```python
from pyhealth.data import (
    SignalProcessor,
    MultiClassLabelProcessor,
    SampleProcessor
)

# Signal preprocessing
signal_processor = SignalProcessor(
    sampling_rate=100,
    bandpass_filter=(0.3, 35),  # EEG frequency range
    segment_length=30  # 30-second epochs
)

# Label processing
label_processor = MultiClassLabelProcessor(
    num_classes=5,  # W, N1, N2, N3, REM
    class_weight="balanced"
)

# Combine
sample_processor = SampleProcessor(
    input_processors={"signal": signal_processor},
    output_processor=label_processor
)
```

### Workflow 3: Drug Recommendation

```python
from pyhealth.data import (
    SequenceProcessor,
    MultiLabelProcessor,

)

# Input processing
input_processors = {
    "diagnoses": SequenceProcessor(max_seq_length=50),

}

# Multi-label output (multiple drugs)
output_processor = MultiLabelProcessor(
    num_labels=150,  # number of possible drugs
    threshold=0.5
)

sample_processor = SampleProcessor(
    input_processors=input_processors,
    output_processor=output_processor
)
```

### Workflow 4: Length of Stay Prediction

sample_processor = SampleProcessor(
    input_processors=input_processors,
    output_processor=output_processor
)
```

## Best Practices

### Sequence Processing

1. **Choose appropriate max_seq_length**: Balance between context and computation
   - Short sequences (20-50): Fast, less context
   - Medium sequences (50-100): Good balance
   - Long sequences (100+): More context, slower

2. **Truncation strategy**:
   - "post": Keep most recent events (recommended for clinical prediction)
   - "pre": Keep earliest events

3. **Padding strategy**:
   - "post": Pad at end (standard)
   - "pre": Pad at beginning

### Feature Encoding

1. **Vocabulary size**: Limit to frequent codes
   - `min_freq=5`: Include codes appearing ≥5 times
   - `max_vocab_size=10000`: Cap total vocabulary size

2. **Handle rare codes**: Group into "unknown" category

3. **Missing values**:
   - Imputation (mean, median, forward-fill)
   - Indicator variables
   - Special tokens

### Normalization

1. **Numeric features**: Always normalize
   - Z-score: Standard scaling (mean=0, std=1)
   - Min-max: Range scaling [0, 1]

2. **Compute statistics on training set only**: Prevent data leakage

3. **Apply same normalization to val/test sets**

### Class Imbalance

1. **Use class weighting**: `class_weight="balanced"`

2. **Consider oversampling**: For very rare positive cases

3. **Evaluate with appropriate metrics**: AUROC, AUPRC, F1

### Performance Optimization

1. **Cache processed data**: Save preprocessing results

2. **Parallel processing**: Use `num_workers` for DataLoader

3. **Batch processing**: Process multiple samples at once

4. **Feature selection**: Remove low-information features

### Validation

1. **Check processed shapes**: Ensure correct dimensions

2. **Verify value ranges**: After normalization

3. **Inspect samples**: Manually review processed data

4. **Monitor memory usage**: Especially for large datasets

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Error:**
- Reduce `max_seq_length`
- Use smaller batches
- Process data in chunks
- Enable caching to disk

**Slow Processing:**
- Enable parallel processing (`num_workers`)
- Cache preprocessed data
- Reduce feature dimensionality
- Use more efficient data types

**Shape Mismatch:**
- Check sequence lengths
- Verify padding configuration
- Ensure consistent processor settings

**NaN Values:**
- Handle missing data explicitly
- Check normalization parameters
- Verify imputation strategy

**Class Imbalance:**
- Use class weighting
- Consider oversampling
- Adjust decision threshold
- Use appropriate evaluation metrics
