1. **Analyzes Image Quality**: Checks resolution, sharpness, and compression artifacts
2. **Enhances Resolution**: Upscales images intelligently
3. **Improves Sharpness**: Enhances edges and details
4. **Reduces Artifacts**: Cleans up compression artifacts and noise
5. **Optimizes for Use Case**: Adjusts based on intended use (web, print, social media)

## How to Use
